# Scaling Agile BI

*   **Foundation & Mindset**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scaling starts with stable, successful Agile teams at the single-team level.
*   Do not attempt to scale a process that isn't working for one team.
*   Establish a common "BI Language" and standards across the organization.
*   Focus on aligning teams around business value streams, not just technology.

**Frameworks for Scaling**

*   **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) for BI**
> [!NOTE]
> SAFe organizes teams around value streams and uses a Program Increment (PI) planning cycle.
*   Multiple BI teams plan together in a Big Room PI Planning event.
*   Creates a unified plan for large-scale data and analytics initiatives.
*   Defines clear dependencies between BI teams, data engineering, and IT.
*   Establishes a System Architect role to oversee the overall data platform design.

*   **The Spotify Model Influence**
> [!TIP]
> This model emphasizes autonomy and alignment through "Tribes," "Chapters," and "Guilds."
*   **Tribes:** A collection of BI teams working on a related set of business areas (e.g., "Revenue Tribe").
*   **Chapters:** A horizontal group of people with the same skill (e.g., "Data Modeling Chapter") across different teams.
*   **Guilds:** A community of interest for knowledge sharing (e.g., "DAX Guild," "Power BI Governance Guild").

**Key Scaling Challenges & Solutions**

*   **Dependency Management**
> [!CAUTION]
> BI teams often depend on central data engineering for new data sources.
*   Visualize and track dependencies on a program board.
*   Establish "Scrum of Scrums" meetings where team representatives coordinate.
*   Feature teams can include both BI developers and data engineers.

*   **Governance & Standards**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Standardization is critical at scale to prevent chaos and technical debt.
*   Create a central "BI Center of Excellence" to define and evangelize best practices.
*   Establish common standards for: Data modeling, DAX patterns, PBIX file structure, and Security (RLS).
*   Use shared Power BI datasets to serve as "single sources of truth."

*   **Unified Backlog & Prioritization**
*   Move from team-level backlogs to a centralized, business-prioritized Portfolio Backlog.
*   A central "BI Product Management" role ensures alignment with enterprise strategy.
*   Prioritization must balance new feature requests with platform sustainability and tech debt.

*   **Technical Architecture for Scale**
*   Promote the use of certified, enterprise-wide datasets over isolated, team-specific models.
*   Implement a robust deployment pipeline (Dev/Test/Prod) with automated checks.
*   Use Power BI Premium capacity for guaranteed performance and larger data volumes.
