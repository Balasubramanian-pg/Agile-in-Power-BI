# Agile Documentation Standards for BI Deliverables

## Fundamentals: The Agile Documentation Mindset for BI

### The Core Principle: "Just Enough, Just in Time"

*   **Agile documentation** is not about creating exhaustive, encyclopedic documents upfront. It is the practice of creating **lightweight, valuable, and living documentation** that serves a clear purpose.
*   The primary goal is to **facilitate communication and provide clarity**, not to create a document for the sake of a process.
*   It contrasts sharply with traditional approaches, which often involve creating voluminous specification documents that are expensive to produce, quickly become outdated, and are rarely read.

### Key Tenets of Agile BI Documentation

*   **Focus on Value, Not Volume**: A simple, up-to-date data dictionary is infinitely more valuable than a 100-page design document that is six months out of date.
*   **Embrace a "Single Source of Truth" (SSoT)**: A piece of information, especially a critical business metric definition, should exist in one and only one authoritative place. This prevents ambiguity and inconsistency.
*   **Documentation as Code**: The best documentation is generated automatically from the code and configuration itself. It can't become stale because it's part of the development workflow.
*   **The Best Documentation is a Working Product**: A well-designed, intuitive dashboard with clear labels and embedded help is its own best documentation.
*   **Integrate into the Workflow**: Documentation is not a separate phase. It is a continuous activity and a mandatory part of the team's **Definition of Done (DoD)**.

> [!WARNING]
> The biggest failure of documentation is when it becomes stale. Stale documentation is worse than no documentation because it actively misleads people and erodes trust in both the documentation and the data itself.

## The BI Documentation Pyramid: What to Document

This framework helps categorize documentation from high-level strategic context to low-level technical details, ensuring all needs are met without over-investing in any one area.

### Level 1 (The Peak): The "Why" - Strategic and Visionary Documentation

*   **Purpose**: To provide context, alignment, and direction for the entire BI program.
*   **Audience**: Leadership, stakeholders, and the entire BI team.
*   **Examples**:
    *   **BI Product Vision**: A concise statement describing the ultimate goal of the BI solution, its target audience, and the value it provides.
    *   **High-Level Roadmap**: A visual overview of the major features (epics) planned over the next few quarters.
    *   **Business Glossary**: A high-level, non-technical glossary of key business terms.
*   **Characteristics**: Lightweight, reviewed quarterly, and stored in a central, accessible location like Confluence or a team wiki.

### Level 2 (The Middle): The "What" - Tactical, Sprint-Level Documentation

*   **Purpose**: To define the work being done in the current and upcoming sprints. This documentation is conversational and ephemeral.
*   **Audience**: The development team, the Product Owner, and immediate stakeholders.
*   **Examples**:
    *   **User Stories**: Written in the standard "As a..., I want..., so that..." format.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable conditions that define when a user story is "done." Written in a Given/When/Then format.
    *   **Mockups and Wireframes**: Simple visual sketches that clarify the layout and functionality of a new report.
*   **Characteristics**: Lives in the project management tool (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps). It's highly detailed for active work but can be archived after completion.

### Level 3 (The Base): The "How" - Living Technical and User-Facing Documentation

*   **Purpose**: This is the most critical and enduring layer. It explains how the BI solution works, how to use it, and where the data comes from. It must be kept up-to-date.
*   **Audience**: BI developers, data analysts, technical support, and end-users.
*   **This is the "Single Source of Truth" for your data assets.**

## Deep Dive: The "How" - Documenting Your BI Assets

This is the foundation of trustworthy, scalable BI.

### 1. The Data Model (The Semantic Layer)

This is the most important asset to document. If your data model is a black box, your entire BI solution will be untrustworthy.

*   **Data Dictionary**:
    *   **What it is**: The definitive guide to your data model. For every table and column, it should define:
        *   **Business Definition**: A clear, plain-language description (e.g., `is_active_customer` - "A flag indicating if the customer has made a purchase in the last 12 months.").
        *   **Calculation Logic**: For calculated columns and measures, the exact DAX or SQL formula used.
        *   **Data Type**: Text, Number, Date, etc.
        *   **Source**: The original source table and column.
    *   **Best Practice**: Use a tool like **dbt Docs** that automatically generates the data dictionary from descriptions written directly in your SQL transformation code (documentation as code).
*   **Data Lineage**:
    *   **What it is**: A visual map that shows the journey of data from the source systems, through all the transformation steps, to the final report.
    *   **Why it's critical**: When a number on a dashboard looks wrong, lineage is the first tool you use to trace it back to the source and find the point of failure.
    *   **Best Practice**: Again, tools like dbt automatically generate interactive lineage graphs.
*   **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
    *   A visual diagram showing the tables in your model and the relationships (joins) between them. This is essential for helping developers and analysts understand how to query the data correctly.

### 2. The Reports and Dashboards

Documentation here should be aimed at the end-user and live as close to the report as possible.

*   **In-Dashboard "Info" Page or Help Section**:
    *   Create a dedicated, hidden tab or a pop-up modal in your dashboard that contains key metadata.
    *   **Purpose**: What business questions does this dashboard answer?
    *   **Data Owner**: Who is the primary contact for questions or issues?
    *   **Data Freshness**: When was the data last refreshed?
    *   **Metric Definitions**: A brief explanation of the key KPIs on the dashboard.
*   **Tooltips and Labels**:
    *   Use descriptive titles for all charts and tables.
    *   Configure tooltips on charts to provide additional context or definitions when a user hovers over a data point.

### 3. The Code and Transformations

*   **Version Control History**: A well-maintained Git history is a form of documentation.
    *   **Good Commit Messages**: Instead of "updated script," write "feat(sales): Add gross_margin calculation to fct_orders." This explains the *intent* of the change.
*   **In-line Code Comments**: Use comments in complex SQL or DAX to explain the "why," not the "what."
    *   *Bad Comment*: `-- Select customer ID` (The code already says that).
    *   *Good Comment*: `-- This complex join is necessary to handle legacy customer accounts from the pre-2018 CRM system.`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Make documentation part of your Definition of Done (DoD).** A user story is not complete until the code is written, the tests have passed, *and* the relevant documentation (e.g., the data dictionary) has been updated. This is a non-negotiable team agreement.

## Flashcard-Style Q&A

*   **Q: What is the main philosophy of Agile documentation?**
    *   **A:** To create "just enough" documentation, "just in time," with a primary focus on facilitating communication and providing value, rather than producing exhaustive upfront specifications.

*   **Q: What is a "Single Source of Truth" in the context of BI documentation?**
    *   **A:** It is the practice of ensuring that a critical piece of information, like the definition of a key business metric, is stored and maintained in one and only one authoritative place to prevent inconsistency.

*   **Q: What is the most critical asset to document in any BI solution?**
    *   **A:** The data model (the semantic layer), through tools like a data dictionary and data lineage graphs, because it is the foundation of trust for all reports.

*   **Q: What does "documentation as code" mean?**
    *   **A:** It is the practice of writing documentation directly alongside the development code (e.g., in YAML files or SQL headers) so that it can be version controlled and automatically generated by tools like dbt Docs. This ensures the documentation stays synchronized with the code.

*   **Q: How can a team ensure that documentation is consistently maintained?**
    *   **A:** By including specific documentation tasks (e.g., "Update the Data Dictionary") as a mandatory checklist item in their Definition of Done (DoD) for every user story.
