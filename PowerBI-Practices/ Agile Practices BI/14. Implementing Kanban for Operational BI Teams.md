# Implementing Kanban for Operational BI Teams

## Fundamentals: Why Kanban is a Natural Fit for Operational BI

### Definition and Context

*   An **Operational BI Team** is a team whose primary function is to maintain and enhance existing BI solutions. Their workflow is characterized by a high volume of small, unpredictable, and often urgent tasks, rather than large, long-term projects. This includes ad-hoc data requests, bug fixes, minor enhancements, and system monitoring.
*   **Kanban** is an Agile methodology focused on managing the flow of work. Unlike Scrum, which uses fixed-length, time-boxed sprints, Kanban is a **continuous flow system**.
*   The core principle of Kanban is to **visualize your work, limit your work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency (flow)**. It is designed to embrace variability and frequent re-prioritization, making it an ideal framework for the reactive nature of operational BI.

### Scrum vs. Kanban: The Key Difference for Operational Teams

*   **Scrum** is designed to *protect* the team from unplanned work for the duration of a sprint to allow them to focus on a pre-defined sprint goal. This model often breaks down for operational teams because their primary job is to *handle* unplanned work.
*   **Kanban** is designed to *manage* the flow of unplanned work in a structured, predictable, and efficient way. It doesn't try to stop the unpredictable; it provides a system to tame it.

> [!NOTE]
> The fundamental shift from Scrum to Kanban is moving from a time-boxed, "push" system (planning work into a sprint) to a continuous, "pull" system (pulling the next highest priority item when capacity becomes available).

## The Four Core Principles of Kanban

Implementing Kanban is less about a rigid set of rules and more about embracing four key principles.

1.  **Visualize the Workflow**: You cannot improve what you cannot see. The first step is to create a visual representation of your team's entire process, from request to delivery. This is the **Kanban board**.
2.  **Limit Work In Progress (WIP)**: This is the most critical and powerful principle. By limiting how many tasks can be "in progress" at any one time, the team is forced to **stop starting and start finishing**. This reduces context-switching, exposes bottlenecks, and dramatically improves the speed of delivery for individual items.
3.  **Manage Flow**: The goal is to make work flow smoothly and predictably through the system. This involves monitoring the board, identifying where work gets stuck (bottlenecks), and implementing process improvements to resolve those issues.
4.  **Make Process Policies Explicit**: The team must collaboratively define and agree upon the rules that govern their workflow. For example: What makes a request "ready" to be worked on? What is our "Definition of Done"? How do we handle urgent requests? These explicit policies reduce ambiguity and ensure consistency.

## A Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing Kanban for Your BI Team

### Step 1: Design Your Kanban Board

The board should mirror your actual workflow. Start simple and evolve it over time.

*   **A Typical BI Operational Workflow:**
    *   `Triage / Incoming`: All new requests land here. This is an un-prioritized bucket.
    *   `Ready for Dev`: The Product Owner or team lead has reviewed, clarified, and prioritized these items. They have a clear "Definition of Ready."
    *   `Development (WIP: 3)`: Actively being worked on by a developer (data modeling, query writing, etc.).
    *   `Peer Review (WIP: 2)`: Code is complete, and another team member is reviewing it for quality and correctness.
    *   `Ready for UAT`: The feature is deployed to a test environment and is ready for stakeholder validation.
    *   `UAT / Validation (WIP: 2)`: The business stakeholder is actively testing the solution to confirm it meets their needs.
    *   `Done`: The work has been deployed to production and has met the "Definition of Done."

> [!TIP]
> Use color-coding on your digital or physical cards to represent different **Work Item Types**. For example: **Red** for a production bug, **Yellow** for an ad-hoc data request, and **Blue** for a planned enhancement.

### Step 2: Establish Explicit Policies

Write these down and post them near the board. They are living rules that the team can change in retrospectives.

*   **Definition of Ready (DoR)**: What must be true before an item can be pulled from `Triage` into `Ready for Dev`?
    *   *Example*: "The request has a clear business question, specific acceptance criteria, and the location of the required source data has been identified."
*   **Pull Criteria**: Clearly define the rules for pulling work into the next column. The most important rule is that a team member can only pull a new item when their WIP limit allows and they have free capacity.
*   **Definition of Done (DoD)**: What must be true for an item to be moved to the `Done` column?
    *   *Example*: "Code is deployed, the data dictionary is updated, and the requesting stakeholder has given written confirmation that the solution is accepted."
*   **Expedite Policy**: How do we handle a "drop everything" emergency?
    *   *Example*: Create a single "Expedite" or "Fast Track" lane that bypasses the normal WIP limits. This lane should only ever have **one** item in it at a time. Using it should be a conscious, team-wide decision.

### Step 3: Set Initial WIP Limits

This is the engine of your Kanban system.

*   **Why?**: WIP limits prevent individuals and the team as a whole from being overloaded. This focus dramatically reduces the **Cycle Time** (the time it takes for one item to get from "start" to "done").
*   **How to Start**: A good starting point is **1 to 1.5 items per person** in the "in-progress" columns (`Development`, `Peer Review`, `UAT`).
    *   For a team of 3 developers, a WIP limit of 3 or 4 for the `Development` column is a reasonable start.
*   **What happens when a WIP limit is hit?**: If the `Development` column is full and a developer finishes their task, they cannot pull a new one. Instead, they must swarm to help unblock work further down the board (e.g., help with a peer review or assist with UAT). This is how Kanban forces the team to resolve bottlenecks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> WIP limits will feel uncomfortable at first. This is a sign that they are working. The discomfort highlights the system's existing bottlenecks. Resist the urge to raise the limits to feel "busier."

### Step 4: Implement Feedback Loops (The Kanban Cadences)

While Kanban doesn't have prescribed ceremonies like Scrum, successful teams implement regular feedback loops.

1.  **Daily Stand-up (The Daily Kanban Meeting)**:
    *   **Focus**: Unlike a Scrum stand-up, the focus is on the **flow of work**, not on the people. The team "walks the board" from right to left (from `Done` to `In Progress`).
    *   **Key Questions**: "What can we do to move this card to the next column?" "What is blocking this item?" "Is anything threatening our ability to deliver soon?"
2.  **Replenishment and Commitment Meeting**:
    *   **Frequency**: Weekly or as needed.
    *   **Purpose**: This is the Kanban equivalent of sprint planning. The team reviews items in the `Triage` or `Backlog` column, discusses requirements with the Product Owner, and decides which items are "Ready" to be pulled into the system. The team commits to pulling work from the `Ready` queue as capacity becomes available.
3.  **Service Delivery Review / Retrospective**:
    *   **Frequency**: Bi-weekly or monthly.
    *   **Purpose**: To analyze the team's performance and identify opportunities for process improvement. This is where the team reviews their Kanban metrics (see below) and decides to experiment with changes (e.g., adjusting WIP limits, changing a policy, or modifying the board).

## Key Kanban Metrics for BI Teams

Kanban uses metrics that are focused on the flow of value.

*   **Cycle Time**:
    *   **What it is**: The total time a work item spends from the moment work begins (`Development`) until it is delivered (`Done`).
    *   **Why it matters**: This is your team's "time to market" for a single request. Reducing cycle time is a primary goal. A **Cycle Time Scatterplot** is a powerful chart that shows the delivery time for every completed item and helps you make service-level agreements (SLAs).
*   **Throughput**:
    *   **What it is**: The number of work items completed in a given time period (e.g., items per week).
    *   **Why it matters**: This is a measure of your team's delivery rate. Unlike Scrum's velocity, it's not used for future commitment but as a historical indicator of the team's capacity and process health.
*   **Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)**:
    *   **What it is**: A stacked area chart that shows the number of work items in each stage of your workflow over time.
    *   **Why it matters**: It provides a high-level visualization of the health of your system. A widening band for any particular column indicates a bottleneck where work is piling up faster than it is being completed.

## Flashcard-Style Q&A

*   **Q: What is the main difference between Scrum and Kanban for an operational BI team?**
    *   **A:** Scrum uses fixed-length sprints to protect the team from unplanned work, while Kanban is a continuous flow system designed to manage the flow of unpredictable, unplanned work efficiently.

*   **Q: What is the most important and powerful principle of Kanban?**
    *   **A:** Limiting Work In Progress (WIP). It forces the team to focus on finishing tasks, reduces context-switching, and immediately exposes bottlenecks in the workflow.

*   **Q: In a Kanban daily stand-up, what is the primary focus of the conversation?**
    *   **A:** The focus is on the flow of work on the board, not on individual team members. The team asks, "What can we do to move this card?" to ensure work is constantly progressing.

*   **Q: What is "Cycle Time"?**
    *   **A:** The total elapsed time from when work begins on an item until it is delivered to the "Done" column. It is a key measure of the team's speed and predictability for a single request.

*   **Q: How should a Kanban team handle an urgent, "drop everything" request?**
    *   **A:** By having an explicit policy for it, typically using a dedicated "Expedite Lane" on the Kanban board that bypasses normal WIP limits but is strictly limited to one item at a time.
