# Managing Data Dependencies Within Sprints

## Fundamentals of Data Dependencies in BI

### Definition and Explanations

*   A **data dependency** in a Business Intelligence (BI) context is a situation where one piece of work cannot be started or completed until another piece of work related to data is finished.
*   These dependencies are inherent to BI because analytics are built on a sequential data value chain: data must be sourced, ingested, modeled, and governed before it can be visualized or analyzed.
*   Unlike typical software development, where dependencies might be between features, BI dependencies are often tied to the availability, quality, and structure of the data itself.

### Types of Dependencies in a BI Sprint

*   **Upstream Dependencies**: Work that must be completed *before* the BI team can start their tasks. This is the most common and challenging type.
    *   **Example**: The data engineering team must create and populate a new table in the data warehouse before the BI developer can build a dashboard on top of it.
*   **Downstream Dependencies**: Work that relies on the completion of the BI team's tasks.
    *   **Example**: A data science team is waiting for the BI team to create a finalized, clean dataset so they can use it to train a machine learning model.
*   **Intra-Team Dependencies**: Tasks within the BI team that are sequential.
    *   **Example**: One developer is building the core data model, and another is waiting for it to be completed before they can build complex DAX calculations.
*   **External Dependencies**: The BI team relies on a third party, such as a vendor providing an API or a business department providing manual data files.

> [!WARNING]
> Unmanaged data dependencies are a primary cause of sprint failure in BI. They introduce delays, create bottlenecks, and can completely derail a team's ability to deliver value.

## Challenges Posed by Data Dependencies

*   **Blocked Work and Idle Time**: If an upstream dependency is not met, BI team members can be left with nothing to do on their committed sprint work.
*   **Unpredictable Timelines**: The BI team's success becomes tied to the schedule and priorities of another team, making sprint commitments feel like a gamble.
*   **Reduced Agility**: The team cannot easily pivot or re-prioritize work if they are locked into a sequence dictated by another team's backlog.
*   **Communication Overhead**: A significant amount of time can be spent in meetings, sending emails, and chasing down updates from other teams.
*   **Siloed Knowledge and Goals**: The upstream team may not understand the urgency or the specific data requirements of the BI team, leading to misaligned priorities.

## Strategies for Managing and Mitigating Dependencies

The goal is to move from *reacting* to dependencies to *proactively managing* and, where possible, *eliminating* them.

### 1. Visualize Everything with Dependency Mapping

*   **Definition**: Dependency mapping is the process of visually identifying and documenting the relationships between tasks, teams, and systems.
*   **How to Do It**:
    *   During backlog refinement or sprint planning, use a digital whiteboard or physical board to map out user stories.
    *   Draw lines between stories to indicate dependencies. Use different colors to represent upstream, downstream, and internal dependencies.
    *   Make this map a central artifact for the team, visible to everyone. Tools like Jira, Miro, or Kanban boards can facilitate this.
*   **Benefit**: This creates a shared understanding of the workflow, highlights potential bottlenecks before the sprint begins, and makes the impact of delays clear to everyone.

> [!TIP]
> Make dependency mapping a required step in your "Definition of Ready." A story with unmapped or unresolved dependencies is not ready to be pulled into a sprint.

### 2. Prioritize and Refine with Dependencies in Mind

*   **Decompose User Stories**: Break down large stories into smaller, independent parts. The BI team might be able to work on one part of a feature while the data dependency for another part is being resolved.
*   **Use Spike Stories**: If there is high uncertainty about a data source or an upstream system, create a time-boxed "spike" or research task in a preceding sprint to investigate and clarify the requirements. This turns an unknown dependency into a known one.
*   **Work One Sprint Ahead**: For critical upstream work, ensure it is planned and completed in the sprint *before* the BI team needs it. The Product Owner plays a key role here, negotiating with the other team's Product Owner to get the work prioritized on their backlog.
*   **Use Mock Data or Stubs**: When possible, the BI team can start development using dummy data or a fake API endpoint that mimics the structure of the final data. This allows parallel work streams. Once the real data pipeline is ready, the team can switch the connection.

### 3. Enhance Cross-Team Collaboration

*   **Joint Planning and Refinement**: Invite members of the upstream data team to the BI team's backlog refinement and sprint planning sessions (and vice-versa). This builds empathy and a shared understanding of goals.
*   **Scrum of Scrums**: If multiple teams are interdependent, hold a regular (e.g., twice a week) "Scrum of Scrums" meeting. An ambassador from each team attends to discuss progress, upcoming dependencies, and resolve blockers.
*   **Establish Clear Communication Channels**: Create a dedicated Slack/Teams channel for cross-team communication to ask questions and get quick updates, reducing the need for formal meetings.
*   **Define a "Dependency Owner"**: For each cross-team dependency, assign a specific person from each team to be the point of contact. Their job is to ensure communication flows and commitments are met.

### 4. Long-Term Structural Solutions

*   **Form Cross-Functional Teams**: The ideal Agile solution is to eliminate external dependencies by creating teams that have all the skills needed to deliver an end-to-end feature. This might mean embedding a data engineer directly into the BI team.
*   **InnerSourcing**: Allow teams to contribute directly to other teams' codebases. For example, a BI developer with the right skills could be given access to modify a data pipeline, reducing the bottleneck of waiting for the data engineering team.
*   **Regular Rotation**: Temporarily move people between teams. A BI developer who spends a few sprints with the data engineering team will build relationships and system knowledge that makes future collaboration much smoother.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not pull a story with a high-risk external dependency into a sprint without a firm delivery commitment from the other team. This commitment should include a specific delivery date. The Product Owner is responsible for securing this.

## Flashcard-Style Q&A

*   **Q: What is the most common type of data dependency for a BI team?**
    *   **A:** Upstream dependencies, where the BI team must wait for another team (like data engineering) to complete work first.

*   **Q: What is dependency mapping?**
    *   **A:** The process of visually representing the relationships between tasks and teams to identify potential bottlenecks and align on workflow.

*   **Q: What is a "spike story" and how does it help with dependencies?**
    *   **A:** A time-boxed research task used to investigate an unknown, such as a new data source. It helps by turning an unknown dependency into a known one, allowing for better planning.

*   **Q: Who is primarily responsible for negotiating and aligning priorities with other teams to resolve dependencies?**
    *   **A:** The Product Owner. They are responsible for working with their counterparts on other teams to ensure dependencies are prioritized and scheduled appropriately.

*   **Q: What is the ideal long-term solution to recurring cross-team dependencies?**
    *   **A:** Reorganizing into cross-functional teams that contain all the skills necessary (e.g., data engineering, analytics, visualization) to deliver value independently.
