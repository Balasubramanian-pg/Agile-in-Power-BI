# Balancing Ad-hoc Requests with Sprint Commitments

## The Fundamental Challenge: Planned vs. Unplanned Work

### Definition and Explanations

*   **Sprint Commitments (Planned Work)**: These are the user stories and tasks that the BI team has prioritized, estimated, and committed to delivering within a sprint. This work is typically aligned with a strategic roadmap and a clear sprint goal.
*   **Ad-hoc Requests (Unplanned Work)**: These are unanticipated requests for data, analysis, or small reports that arise from business stakeholders during a sprint. They are often perceived as urgent and require immediate attention, disrupting the planned workflow.

### The Core Conflict in BI

*   The Agile sprint model is designed for predictability and focus, centered around a protected, time-boxed commitment.
*   The nature of BI and analytics, however, is inherently reactive and exploratory. A new report often generates more questions than answers, creating a natural cycle of ad-hoc requests.
*   The conflict arises when the influx of unplanned work is not managed, forcing the team to choose between meeting their sprint commitment and satisfying immediate stakeholder needs.

> [!WARNING]
> Unmanaged ad-hoc work is one of the single biggest threats to a BI team's agility and morale. It leads to context switching, missed sprint goals, team burnout, and a perception that the team is "never delivering on its promises."

## The First Principle: Make All Work Visible

*   The most critical step in managing ad-hoc requests is to ensure they are not "shadow work." Every request, no matter how small or "urgent," must be captured and tracked.
*   **Why this is crucial**:
    *   **Transparency**: It makes the true workload of the team visible to everyone, including stakeholders and management.
    *   **Prioritization**: It allows the Product Owner to make an informed decision about the request's priority relative to other work.
    *   **Data Collection**: It provides historical data on the volume and nature of ad-hoc requests, which is essential for capacity planning.
*   **Implementation**: Use a single, mandatory intake channel for all requests (e.g., a Jira service desk, a Microsoft Form, or a dedicated ticketing system). Discourage requests made via email, direct messages, or hallway conversations.

## Strategy 1: The Capacity Allocation Model (Two-Lane System)

This is one of the most effective and common strategies for managing both types of work within a sprint.

### Concept

*   The team explicitly decides to allocate a percentage of its sprint capacity to planned work (the sprint commitment) and a percentage to unplanned ad-hoc work.
*   **Example Allocation**:
    *   **80% Planned / 20% Unplanned**: A good starting point for a team with a moderate volume of ad-hoc requests.
    *   **70% Planned / 30% Unplanned**: Suitable for teams in a highly reactive environment.
*   This creates two virtual "lanes" of work for the sprint.

### How it Works in Practice

1.  **Sprint Planning**: The team calculates its total capacity (e.g., in story points). Based on the chosen allocation, they commit to a corresponding amount of planned work. If the team's velocity is 50 points, an 80/20 split means they will commit to 40 points for the sprint goal and reserve 10 points for ad-hoc work.
2.  **Managing the Ad-hoc Lane**:
    *   All new ad-hoc requests go through the single intake channel and are triaged by the Product Owner.
    *   If a request is deemed worthy of being addressed in the current sprint, it is estimated and added to the ad-hoc lane, consuming the reserved capacity.
3.  **Handling Overflows**:
    *   **If the ad-hoc capacity is used up**: The Product Owner must negotiate with stakeholders. New requests are either added to the main backlog for a future sprint or, in a true emergency, a discussion is had with the team about swapping out an existing sprint commitment of equal size.
    *   **If the ad-hoc capacity is not fully used**: The team can pull the next highest priority item from the main product backlog into the sprint.

> [!TIP]
> Regularly review the ad-hoc allocation percentage during sprint retrospectives. Use the data you've collected on unplanned work to adjust the split so it accurately reflects reality.

## Strategy 2: The Triage and Prioritization Process

Not all ad-hoc requests are created equal. The Product Owner must act as a gatekeeper, armed with a clear framework for evaluating them.

### Urgency vs. Impact Matrix

This simple matrix helps categorize incoming requests:

*   **High Urgency / High Impact**: (e.g., "The data for the CEO's board meeting presentation is incorrect and needs to be fixed today.")
    *   **Action**: These are genuine emergencies. Address them immediately using the allocated ad-hoc capacity.
*   **Low Urgency / High Impact**: (e.g., "We need a new dashboard to track Q3 marketing campaign performance.")
    *   **Action**: This is valuable work but not an emergency. It should be converted into a proper user story and added to the product backlog to be prioritized for a future sprint.
*   **High Urgency / Low Impact**: (e.g., "I need this specific number for an internal team meeting in an hour, but it's a one-time use.")
    *   **Action**: Challenge the urgency. Can the meeting proceed without it? Can the stakeholder find a "good enough" answer from an existing report? If it must be done, timebox the effort strictly.
*   **Low Urgency / Low Impact**: (e.g., "I'm curious about the sales figures for a minor product line last year.")
    *   **Action**: Politely decline or redirect the user to self-service tools. This type of request should not disrupt planned work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Product Owner is the single point of contact for all incoming requests. Their ability to protect the team by filtering, clarifying, and prioritizing this work is critical for success.

## Strategy 3: Long-Term Solution - Fostering a Self-Service Culture

The most effective way to reduce the volume of ad-hoc requests is to empower users to answer their own questions.

### Key Initiatives

*   **Develop Certified Data Models**: Invest time in creating clean, reliable, and user-friendly data models (e.g., a Power BI dataset or a Looker model). This provides a "single source of truth" that business users can confidently explore.
*   **Create a Data Dictionary**: Document your key metrics, dimensions, and data sources. When a user asks "What does 'Active Customer' mean?", you can point them to the dictionary.
*   **Provide Training and Office Hours**: Host regular training sessions on how to use self-service BI tools. Hold "office hours" where users can drop in to ask questions and get guidance.
*   **Build Parameterized Reports**: Instead of creating ten variations of the same report, build one flexible report with filters and parameters that allow users to customize the view to their specific needs.

## Strategy 4: The Kanban Approach (An Alternative to Scrum)

For some BI teams, especially those where the work is almost entirely ad-hoc and unpredictable, a pure Scrum model can be frustrating.

*   **Kanban**: A workflow management method focused on continuous flow rather than fixed sprints.
*   **How it Helps**:
    *   It visualizes the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
    *   It uses **Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits** to prevent the team from being overloaded and to encourage finishing tasks before starting new ones.
    *   Priorities can be re-evaluated on a daily basis, making it highly adaptable to a constant stream of new requests.
*   **Scrumban**: A hybrid model that uses the roles and ceremonies of Scrum (like retrospectives and daily stand-ups) but the flow-based system of Kanban. This can be a good compromise for many BI teams.

## Flashcard-Style Q&A

*   **Q: What is the first and most important principle for managing ad-hoc requests?**
    *   **A:** Make all work visible. Every request must be captured and tracked through a single intake channel to ensure transparency and enable prioritization.

*   **Q: What is the "capacity allocation" or "two-lane" model?**
    *   **A:** A strategy where the team dedicates a specific percentage of its sprint capacity to planned sprint work and reserves the rest for unplanned ad-hoc requests.

*   **Q: Who is the key person responsible for triaging and prioritizing incoming ad-hoc requests?**
    *   **A:** The Product Owner. They act as a gatekeeper to protect the team's focus and ensure that only truly urgent and important requests disrupt the sprint.

*   **Q: What is the most effective long-term strategy to reduce the volume of ad-hoc requests?**
    *   **A:** Fostering a culture of self-service by providing users with certified data models, documentation, training, and flexible tools to answer their own questions.

*   **Q: When might a team choose Kanban over Scrum?**
    *   **A:** When their workflow is characterized by a high volume of unpredictable, ad-hoc requests, making fixed sprint commitments impractical. Kanban's continuous flow model is better suited for such highly reactive environments.
