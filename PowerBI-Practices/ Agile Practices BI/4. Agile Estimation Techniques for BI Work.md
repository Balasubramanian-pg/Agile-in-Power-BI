# Agile Estimation Techniques for BI Work

## Core Concepts of Agile Estimation in BI

### Definition and Purpose

*   Agile estimation is the process of predicting the effort required to complete a piece of work in a Business Intelligence (BI) project.
*   Unlike traditional estimation, which focuses on providing an exact time-based deadline (e.g., "this will take 40 hours"), Agile estimation focuses on **relative sizing**.
*   The primary purpose is not to create a rigid contract but to:
    *   **Forecast** how much work can be done over time.
    *   **Facilitate discussion** and create a shared understanding of the work.
    *   **Prioritize** the backlog by understanding the effort-to-value ratio of different features.

> [!NOTE]
> The goal of Agile estimation is to get a "good enough" forecast to make decisions, acknowledging that the inherent uncertainty in BI work makes precise time-based predictions unreliable and often wasteful.

### Why BI Work is Hard to Estimate

*   **Data Discovery**: The effort required to find, understand, and access the correct data is often unknown at the start.
*   **Data Quality Issues**: Unexpected problems with data quality (e.g., nulls, incorrect formats, duplicates) can significantly increase development time.
*   **Complex Logic**: Business rules and calculations can be far more complex than they initially appear.
*   **Evolving Requirements**: As stakeholders see the data, their requirements often change, a natural part of the analytics process.

Agile estimation techniques are designed to embrace this uncertainty rather than ignore it.

## Technique 1: Story Points

### Definition

*   A **story point** is a unitless, abstract measure of the effort required to implement a user story.
*   It is a **relative value**, meaning a story estimated at 8 points is considered to be roughly twice the effort of a story estimated at 4 points.
*   Story points are a team's unique measure and cannot be compared between different teams.

### What Makes Up a Story Point?

A story point estimate is a blend of three key factors:

1.  **Complexity**: How difficult is the work? Are the data transformations complex? Is the DAX or SQL logic challenging?
2.  **Volume of Work**: How much is there to do? Does the story involve creating one simple chart or a dashboard with ten interconnected visuals?
3.  **Uncertainty and Risk**: How much is unknown? Are we using a new, unfamiliar data source? Are the requirements ambiguous? Is there a dependency on another team?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A common mistake is to equate story points directly to time (e.g., 1 point = 4 hours). This defeats the purpose of relative estimation and reintroduces the pressure of time-based deadlines, ignoring the value of accounting for complexity and uncertainty.

### The Fibonacci Sequence in Estimation

*   Teams often use a modified Fibonacci sequence for story point values: **1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100**.
*   **Why this scale?** The increasing gap between numbers reflects the growing uncertainty associated with larger tasks. The difference between a 1 and a 2 is small and well-understood. The difference between a 20 and a 40 is large, acknowledging that such a big task has a high degree of uncertainty and should probably be broken down.

### How to Estimate with Story Points: Planning Poker®

Planning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating user stories.

**The Process:**

1.  **Establish a Baseline**: The team first agrees on a simple, well-understood story and assigns it a baseline value (e.g., a 2-point story). This story becomes the reference point for all future estimations.
2.  **Present the Story**: The Product Owner presents a user story, explaining the business need and acceptance criteria.
3.  **Discussion and Q&A**: The development team asks clarifying questions to ensure they understand the work involved.
4.  **Private Estimation**: Each team member privately chooses a card from their Planning Poker deck that represents their estimate.
5.  **Simultaneous Reveal**: Everyone reveals their chosen card at the same time.
6.  **Discuss Outliers**: If there are significant differences in the estimates, the team members with the highest and lowest estimates explain their reasoning. This is the most valuable part of the process, as it uncovers hidden assumptions and shares knowledge across the team.
7.  **Re-vote**: The team repeats the estimation process until a consensus is reached on a single number.

## Technique 2: T-Shirt Sizing

### Definition

*   T-Shirt Sizing is a less granular, quicker form of relative estimation.
*   Instead of numeric points, the team assigns sizes like **XS, S, M, L, XL**.
*   This technique is excellent for getting a quick, high-level understanding of the effort for a large number of items.

### How it Works

1.  **Define the Sizes**: The team agrees on what each t-shirt size represents in terms of relative effort.
2.  **Assign Sizes**: As the Product Owner presents items, the team discusses and assigns a size to each. The conversation is less detailed than in Planning Poker.

### When to Use T-Shirt Sizing in BI

*   **Roadmap Planning**: Quickly sizing epics or large features to create a long-term forecast.
*   **Initial Backlog Refinement**: When a backlog is new or has many raw ideas, t-shirt sizing helps to quickly categorize them by effort.
*   **Projects with High Uncertainty**: When the details are too vague for numeric estimation, t-shirt sizing provides a useful starting point.

> [!TIP]
> Teams often map t-shirt sizes to story point ranges to bridge high-level and detailed planning. For example: S = 2-3 points, M = 5-8 points, L = 13-20 points. This allows for a quick initial sizing that can be refined with story points later.

## Comparison: Story Points vs. T-Shirt Sizing

| Feature | Story Points | T-Shirt Sizing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Granularity** | Higher (numeric scale) | Lower (categorical scale) |
| **Precision** | More precise, better for detailed planning | Less precise, better for high-level overview |
| **Best Use Case** | **Sprint Planning**: Committing to work for the next 2-4 weeks. | **Roadmap Planning**: Forecasting work for the next 3-12 months. |
| **Effort to Use** | More time-consuming (requires Planning Poker) | Faster and less formal |
| **Primary Output** | A number used to calculate **velocity** | A relative size category for prioritization |

## Practical Application: Velocity

### Definition

*   **Velocity** is the average number of story points a team successfully completes (i.e., meets the Definition of Done) in a sprint.
*   It is calculated by averaging the total points completed over the last 3-4 sprints to get a stable, reliable measure.

### Purpose of Velocity

*   **Forecasting**: Velocity is a powerful forecasting tool. If the remaining backlog has 200 story points and the team's average velocity is 20 points per sprint, the team can forecast that it will take approximately 10 more sprints to complete the work.
*   **Sprint Commitment**: During sprint planning, the team uses their velocity as a guide for how much work they can realistically commit to in the upcoming sprint.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Velocity is a forecasting tool, NOT a productivity metric.** Using it to compare teams, judge performance, or pressure a team to "increase their velocity" is a misuse of the metric and will lead to inflated estimates and reduced quality.

## Flashcard-Style Q&A

*   **Q: What are the three factors that contribute to a story point estimate?**
    *   **A:** Complexity, Volume of Work, and Uncertainty/Risk.

*   **Q: Why is the Fibonacci sequence used for story points?**
    *   **A:** The increasing gaps between numbers reflect the higher uncertainty that comes with larger, more complex work, forcing the team to make a clearer choice.

*   **Q: What is the primary goal of the discussion during Planning Poker?**
    *   **A:** To create a shared understanding of the work by allowing team members to share their perspectives, assumptions, and concerns, especially those with high or low estimates.

*   **Q: When is T-shirt sizing more appropriate than story points?**
    *   **A:** For high-level planning, such as estimating large epics on a product roadmap, or for initial backlog refinement when details are still vague.

*   **Q: How is velocity calculated, and what is its main purpose?**
    *   **A:** It is the average number of story points completed per sprint. Its main purpose is for forecasting and helping the team make realistic commitments during sprint planning.

*   **Q: What is the biggest mistake a manager can make with velocity?**
    *   **A:** Using it as a performance metric to compare teams or pressure a single team to increase its velocity, which corrupts the estimation process.
