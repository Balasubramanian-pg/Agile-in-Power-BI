# Structuring Demo Sessions for Dashboard Feedback

## Fundamentals: The Purpose of a Dashboard Demo Session

### Definition and Explanations

*   A dashboard demo session, often called a "sprint review" or "feedback session" in an Agile context, is a structured meeting where the BI team showcases a new or updated dashboard to stakeholders.
*   Its primary purpose is **not** to train users or simply present a finished product. Instead, it is a collaborative, working session designed to **elicit high-quality, actionable feedback** to ensure the final product meets business needs.
*   The mindset should shift from a one-way "presentation" to a two-way "conversation."

### The Core Goals

*   **Validate the Solution**: Confirm that the dashboard accurately addresses the business problem and the requirements defined in the user stories.
*   **Gather Feedback**: Collect specific, constructive feedback on usability, data accuracy, visual design, and overall effectiveness.
*   **Create Alignment**: Ensure that both the development team and the business stakeholders have a shared understanding of the dashboard's capabilities and limitations.
*   **Build Trust and Buy-in**: Involving stakeholders in the development process fosters a sense of ownership and increases the likelihood of adoption.

> A successful demo session ends with a clear list of actionable next steps, not just applause. The goal is to make the dashboard better, not to seek approval.

## The Three Phases of a Successful Demo Session

A well-structured demo session can be broken down into three critical phases: Before, During, and After the session.

### Phase 1: Before the Demo (Preparation is Key)

This is the most critical phase. A lack of preparation will derail even the best-built dashboard.

*   **[ ] Define the Goal of This Specific Session**:
    *   What do you need to learn from the audience? Be specific.
    *   *Good Example*: "Our goal is to validate that the three main KPIs on the executive summary tab are the correct metrics for weekly performance reviews."
    *   *Bad Example*: "To show the new dashboard."
*   **[ ] Identify the Right Audience**:
    *   Invite the key stakeholders who will actually use the dashboard to make decisions.
    *   Keep the group small (ideally 5-7 people) to encourage active participation from everyone. A larger audience can be invited for a final "launch" demo, but feedback sessions should be intimate.
    *   Assign roles:
        *   **Presenter/Driver**: The person operating the dashboard.
        *   **Facilitator**: The person guiding the conversation, keeping it on track, and ensuring everyone participates.
        *   **Note-Taker**: The person dedicated to capturing all feedback, questions, and decisions.
*   **[ ] Create and Share a Clear Agenda**:
    *   An agenda manages expectations and keeps the meeting focused. Send it out at least a day in advance.
    *   **Sample Agenda (45-minute session):**
        *   *(5 min)*: Welcome & Session Goal
        *   *(5 min)*: Recap of the Business Problem
        *   *(15 min)*: Guided Dashboard Walkthrough
        *   *(15 min)*: Structured Feedback & Discussion
        *   *(5 min)*: Summary of Feedback & Next Steps
*   **[ ] Prepare the Dashboard and Data**:
    *   Ensure the dashboard is working correctly in the environment you'll be using. Test all filters, drill-downs, and links.
    *   Use realistic but "clean" data. Avoid using data that has known errors or will distract the audience from the dashboard's functionality.
*   **[ ] Prepare Guiding, Open-Ended Questions**:
    *   Do not ask "Do you like it?". This elicits a simple yes/no response.
    *   Instead, prepare questions that prompt thoughtful, detailed feedback. (See examples in the next section).

### Phase 2: During the Demo (Execution and Facilitation)

How you conduct the session is just as important as the dashboard itself.

1.  **Set the Stage (5 mins)**:
    *   Welcome everyone and thank them for their time.
    *   **State the goal of the session explicitly**: "Today, we are looking for your feedback on the usability of the new sales pipeline dashboard. We want to know if this helps you identify at-risk deals more easily."
    *   **Briefly recap the business problem**: "As a reminder, we built this to solve the problem of having no single view of our sales pipeline, which was leading to inaccurate forecasting."
    *   **Set expectations**: Clarify what you are and are not looking for. "Today, we are focused on the layout and the KPIs. We are not discussing the color scheme, as that is set by the corporate branding guide."
2.  **Tell a Story, Don't Just Click Buttons (15 mins)**:
    *   Structure the demo around a realistic business scenario or user journey.
    *   *Good Example*: "Imagine you are a regional sales manager starting your Monday. The first question you have is, 'Which of my deals are most likely to close this week?' You would start here on the summary page and look at the 'Expected Close Date' filter..."
    *   This narrative approach helps stakeholders see how the dashboard fits into their actual workflow.
    *   Pause at logical points. Don't rush through the entire dashboard at once. Demo a specific feature or view, then pause for feedback on that section.
3.  **Facilitate a Structured Feedback Discussion (15 mins)**:
    *   This is the core of the meeting. Use your pre-prepared, open-ended questions to guide the conversation.
    *   **Excellent Guiding Questions**:
        *   "Walk me through how you would use this page to answer [a specific business question]."
        *   "What information is missing from this view that would prevent you from making a decision?"
        *   "Based on what you see in this chart, what is the next question you would want to ask?"
        *   "Is there anything on this page that you find confusing or counter-intuitive?"
        *   "How does this compare to the way you currently get this information?"
    *   **Actively Listen and Probe**: When someone says, "I don't like this chart," don't move on. Ask "why."
        *   *Follow-up*: "Can you tell me more about that? What about it isn't working for you? Is the data unclear, or is it the chart type?"
    *   **Encourage Participation**: If some people are quiet, directly and politely invite them to contribute: "Sarah, from your perspective in marketing, does this view of lead sources make sense?"

> [!TIP]
> Use the "I notice, I wonder" framework. Ask stakeholders to frame their feedback as "I notice that the revenue is broken down by month..." and "I wonder if we could also see it by product category." This encourages observation before jumping to solutions.

4.  **Wrap Up and Confirm Next Steps (5 mins)**:
    *   The note-taker or facilitator should quickly summarize the key feedback points and action items.
    *   **Verbally confirm the summary**: "What I've heard is that we need to add a filter for sales stage, change the 'Revenue' KPI to 'Contribution Margin', and fix the label on the x-axis of the trend chart. Does that sound right?"
    *   Thank everyone for their time and valuable input.
    *   Provide a general timeline for when they can expect to see the requested changes.

### Phase 3: After the Demo (Closing the Loop)

The work isn't finished when the meeting ends.

*   **[ ] Synthesize and Organize Feedback**:
    *   Immediately after the session, the BI team should review the notes.
    *   Categorize the feedback (e.g., UI/UX change, Data Model change, Bug Fix, New Feature).
*   **[ ] Prioritize and Create Backlog Items**:
    *   The Product Owner turns the synthesized feedback into well-defined user stories or tasks.
    *   These new items are then prioritized in the product backlog alongside other work.
*   **[ ] Communicate and Close the Loop**:
    *   Send a follow-up email to all attendees within 24 hours.
    *   The email should include a thank you, a summary of the key feedback points, and the list of prioritized next steps.
    *   This simple act shows that you listened and are taking their feedback seriously, which is crucial for building stakeholder trust.

## Flashcard-Style Q&A

*   **Q: What is the primary goal of a dashboard demo session?**
    *   **A:** To elicit high-quality, actionable feedback from stakeholders in a collaborative session, not to simply present a finished product.

*   **Q: What is the most critical phase for ensuring a successful demo session?**
    *   **A:** The preparation phase. This includes defining the session's goal, inviting the right audience, setting an agenda, and preparing guiding questions.

*   **Q: Instead of asking "Do you like it?", what is a better, open-ended question to ask?**
    *   **A:** "Walk me through how you would use this dashboard to answer [a specific business question]?" or "What information is missing from this view that you would need to make a decision?"

*   **Q: Why is it better to "tell a story" during a demo rather than just clicking through features?**
    *   **A:** Storytelling places the dashboard in the context of a real-world business scenario, helping stakeholders understand how it fits into their daily workflow and making the feedback more relevant.

*   **Q: What is the final, crucial step after the demo session is over?**
    *   **A:** To send a follow-up summary to attendees that outlines the feedback received and the prioritized next steps. This closes the loop and builds trust.
