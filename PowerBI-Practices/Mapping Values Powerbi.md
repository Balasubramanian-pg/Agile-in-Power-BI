# Mapping Values in Power BI Agile

*   **Business Value to Backlog Items**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every backlog item must trace back to a clear business outcome.
*   Map user stories to specific business goals and KPIs.
*   Prioritize features that enable faster or better decision-making.
*   Focus on deliverables that provide immediate operational insight.
*   Eliminate "nice-to-have" features with unclear business impact.

*   **Agile Principles to Power BI Practices**
> [!TIP]
> Translate Agile values into specific Power BI development habits.
*   **Individuals & Interactions** = Daily stand-ups discussing data models, not just reports.
*   **Working Software** = A published, refreshed, and functional .pbix file.
*   **Customer Collaboration** = Co-designing visuals with business users in real-time.
*   **Responding to Change** = Quickly modifying DAX measures based on new requirements.

*   **Stakeholder Needs to Report Features**
> [!NOTE]
> Create a direct mapping between user roles and dashboard capabilities.
*   Sales Manager → Sales performance vs target visuals.
*   Marketing Analyst → Customer segmentation and campaign tracking.
*   Operations Lead → Process efficiency and bottleneck identification.
*   Executive → High-level KPI summary with drill-through capabilities.

*   **Data Sources to Business Insights**
> [!CAUTION]
> Maintain clear lineage from raw data to final business insight.
*   Source System → Data Flow → Data Model → DAX Measure → Visual → Decision.
*   Document how each data element supports specific business questions.
*   Ensure data quality checks are mapped to critical business metrics.
*   Track how changes in source systems impact existing reports.

*   **Team Effort to Business Impact**
*   Map sprint deliverables to specific stakeholder value propositions.
*   Balance technical debt reduction with new feature development.
*   Allocate capacity for data quality improvements that prevent bad decisions.
*   Measure success by business adoption, not just completed tasks.

*   **Agile Ceremonies to Power BI Outcomes**
*   **Sprint Planning** = Commitment to specific dataset or report improvements.
*   **Daily Stand-up** = Unblocking data access or calculation issues.
*   **Sprint Review** = Demo of new analytics capabilities to business users.
*   **Retrospective** = Improving data modeling and development processes.
