# Agile Practices BI

*   **Core Agile BI Mindset**
> [!TIP]
> Treat BI as a continuous discovery process, not a one-time reporting project.
*   Focus on delivering insights quickly and iteratively.
*   Embrace changing business questions and data needs.
*   Prioritize actionable data over perfect data.

**Key Agile Practices in BI**

*   **Iterative Dashboard Development**
> [!NOTE]
> Start with a simple, single-page dashboard containing only the most critical KPIs.
*   Release this "MVP" (Minimum Viable Product) to business users quickly.
*   Gather feedback and add new visuals, filters, and pages in subsequent cycles.
*   This ensures you are building what users actually need and use.

*   **The Product Backlog for BI**
*   Maintain a prioritized list of all potential BI work items.
*   Includes new reports, data source integrations, metric calculations, and data quality fixes.
*   The Product Owner (e.g., a business analyst) is responsible for prioritization.
*   Items are refined and pulled into development sprints.

*   **User Stories for BI Requirements**
> [!TIP]
> Frame BI requests as user stories to focus on business value.
*   Example: "As a **regional sales director**, I want **to compare this quarter's sales to the previous quarter by product category** so that **I can identify declining trends.**"
*   This format clearly defines the who, what, and why for the development team.

*   **Sprints for BI Work**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Organize BI development into fixed-length sprints (e.g., 2 weeks).
*   Each sprint delivers a small batch of valuable, working BI content.
*   This could be a new dataset, a set of new measures, or an updated report.
*   Provides a predictable rhythm for delivering new insights.

*   **Daily Stand-ups for BI Teams**
*   The BI team meets daily for 15 minutes to synchronize.
*   Discuss progress on data modeling, ETL pipelines, and report development.
*   Identify blockers like data access issues or server performance problems.
*   Ensures the team is aligned and impediments are quickly resolved.

**Handling BI-Specific Challenges**

*   **Data Modeling & ETL**
> [!CAUTION]
> Building a perfect, monolithic data warehouse upfront is a Waterfall approach.
*   Instead, build data marts or data models incrementally to support specific sprints.
*   Focus on creating clean, well-documented data models that can evolve.
*   Use version control for ETL scripts and data pipeline code.

*   **Stakeholder Collaboration**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Business users must be actively involved throughout the development process.
*   Conduct frequent demo sessions at the end of each sprint to show new features.
*   This continuous feedback loop prevents building unused or incorrect reports.
*   It builds trust and ensures the final product meets business needs.

*   **Definition of "Done" for a BI Story**
*   Data is accurately sourced and transformed.
*   DAX calculations or SQL queries are written, tested, and documented.
*   The report or visual is published to the production environment (e.g., Power BI Service).
*   The report has been reviewed and accepted by the stakeholder.
