# Challenges in Power BI Agile

*   **Data-Related Challenges**
> [!CAUTION]
> Data sourcing and preparation often take much longer than anticipated.
*   Gaining access to source systems can be a major bottleneck.
*   Data quality issues are frequently discovered mid-sprint.
*   Building and testing complex ETL/ELT processes is time-consuming.
*   Data refresh failures in the Power BI Service can derail a sprint review.

*   **Performance & Modeling Challenges**
> [!NOTE]
> A poorly performing model is hard to fix within a short sprint.
*   Pressure to deliver fast can lead to messy, unoptimized data models.
*   Complex DAX calculations require significant testing and tuning.
*   Report performance (load time, visual interaction) is often a late-discovery problem.
*   Lack of data model documentation creates technical debt.

*   **Stakeholder & Process Challenges**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Stakeholders may expect a complete, polished solution immediately.
*   Managing expectations for an "incomplete" MVP dashboard is difficult.
*   Explaining Agile concepts to non-technical business users can be challenging.
*   Ad-hoc reporting requests constantly threaten to disrupt the sprint backlog.
*   Getting timely feedback from busy business users is a common hurdle.

*   **Team & Skill Challenges**
> [!CAUTION]
> Power BI development often requires a blend of skills that are hard to find.
*   Team members need both technical skills (DAX, M, data modeling) and business acumen.
*   Self-organization is difficult if the team lacks experience or authority.
*   Defining a clear "Definition of Done" for a Power BI user story can be ambiguous.

*   **Tooling & Environment Challenges**
*   Managing development, test, and production workspaces adds overhead.
*   Version control for Power BI files (.pbix) is not as straightforward as for code.
*   Deployment pipelines require setup and management.
*   Gateway configurations and data source permissions can cause delays.
