# **PowerBI-Practices**  
## *A Repository for the Serious Practitioner of Agile Business Intelligence*

### **Why This Exists**

You are not here to build pretty charts. You are here to *institutionalize truth*.  

Power BI is not a reporting tool. It is a **system of sense-making**—a nervous system for the modern organization. But like any nervous system, it can be poisoned by noise, clogged by technical debt, or paralyzed by ambiguity.  

This repository is a response to that danger. It is a collection of **practices, not prescriptions**—hard-won lessons from teams who have stared into the abyss of dashboard chaos and chosen, instead, to build with discipline.  

The documents within are grouped into four pillars:  
1. **Agile Practices BI** — *How to run sprints that deliver real insight, not just pixels.*  
2. **Challenges** — *The friction points where theory meets reality—and how to overcome them.*  
3. **Mapping Values PowerBI** — *Connecting technical output to business outcomes.*  
4. **Scaling Agile BI** — *From squad to enterprise: governance without suffocation.*  

And underpinning it all: the **Scrum Framework**, adapted not as dogma, but as a scaffold for accountability.

### **The Core Premise**

**Agile BI fails when it mimics software development without respecting the unique nature of data work.**  

- Data is not code. It is *volatile, contextual, and often incomplete*.  
- A dashboard is not a feature. It is a *hypothesis about what matters*.  
- A sprint is not a deadline. It is a *cycle of validated learning*.  

The practices here are designed to honor that difference.  

For example:  
- **“Writing Effective BI User Stories”** teaches you to frame requests as *testable decisions*, not vague “insights.”  
- **“Handling Mid-Sprint Data Quality Surprises”** gives you protocols to triage without panic.  
- **“Defining and Enforcing ‘Definition of Done’”** ensures that “done” means *“safe to trust,”* not “I stopped working.”  

This is not about velocity. It is about **veracity**.

### **How to Use This Repository**

#### **1. For Teams Starting Their Agile BI Journey**  
Begin with:  
- `Agile Practices BI/0-10/Overview.md`  
- `Challenges/0-10/Readme.md`  
- `Scrum-Framework/Roles.md`  

Focus on **small wins**:  
- Implement a **BI Backlog Refinement Checklist**.  
- Define a **Power BI-specific Definition of Done**.  
- Run **one retrospective** using a format tailored for data teams.  

Do not try to adopt everything at once. **Clarity precedes scale.**

#### **2. For Mature Teams Facing Scaling Challenges**  
Dive into:  
- `Challenges/20-30/Readme.md` (technical debt, rollback, sprawl)  
- `Scaling Agile BI/BI Center of Excellence (CoE) operating model.md`  
- `Agile Practices BI/20-30/Story Mapping for Large BI Initiatives.md`  

Your battle is no longer with basics, but with **entropy**. These documents help you build systems that resist decay.

#### **3. For Leaders and Coaches**  
Study:  
- `Challenges/10-20/Coaching Teams on Agile.md`  
- `Agile Practices BI/10-20/The Role of the Product Owner in BI Teams.md`  
- `Mapping Values Powerbi/Overview.md`  

Your job is not to manage tasks, but to **protect the conditions for truth to emerge**.

### **A Warning**

This repository will not make your life easier in the short term.  

- It will ask you to **slow down** to document DAX logic.  
- It will force you to **say no** to ad-hoc requests that break focus.  
- It will demand you **test data**, not just visuals.  

But in the long term, it will save you from:  
- The 3 a.m. call: *“The executive dashboard is showing $0 revenue!”*  
- The audit finding: *“Unable to verify KPI calculation.”*  
- The team turnover: *“No one knows how this measure works.”*  

**Discipline today prevents disaster tomorrow.**

### **Philosophical Foundation**

> *"Tell me how you measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave."*  
> — Eliyahu Goldratt

In BI, if you measure only **dashboards delivered**, you will get dashboards—many of them wrong.  
If you measure **decisions improved**, you will get systems designed for truth.  

Every document in this repository is aligned to that higher standard.  

- **Version control** is not about files—it is about *traceable truth*.  
- **Regression testing** is not about scripts—it is about *preserving trust*.  
- **Sprint demos** are not about showing off—they are about *validating assumptions*.  

This is the work of **stewardship**, not just development.

### **Contributing**

This is a living repository. If a practice has served you well:  
1. **Add it** in the relevant section.  
2. **Link it** to related challenges.  
3. **Explain not just *how*, but *why***—the principle behind the practice.  

Avoid opinion. Favor evidence.  

> *“The best BI teams are not those with the fanciest visuals, but those with the fewest silent errors.”*

### **Final Thought**

You are not just building reports.  

You are building the **lenses through which your organization sees reality**.  

Make them clear. Make them honest. Make them worthy of the trust placed in them.  

Everything else is decoration.
