Absolutely. Below is your grouped list transformed into a **structured curriculum** for scaling Agile Business Intelligence—each topic now paired with a concise, actionable description that clarifies its purpose and value. This format is ideal for roadmaps, training programs, or executive briefings.

### **1. Governance and Control**  
*Establishing guardrails that enable innovation without chaos.*

- **Power BI governance frameworks**  
  Define policies for data security, sharing, certification, and usage across the enterprise.

- **Role-based access and RLS at scale**  
  Implement and audit Row-Level Security consistently across hundreds of workspaces and datasets.

- **Data quality ownership in Agile BI**  
  Assign clear accountability for data accuracy, lineage, and issue resolution within Agile teams.

- **Governance automation in large BI environments**  
  Use Microsoft Purview, Power Platform admin center, and custom scripts to enforce policies programmatically.

- **Scaling self-service analytics safely**  
  Empower business users to build reports while maintaining compliance, cost control, and data consistency.

- **Power BI version control strategies**  
  Adopt Git-based workflows, ALM Toolkit, or Fabric to manage changes, enable rollback, and support collaboration.

### **2. Architecture and Engineering**  
*Building robust, reusable, and automated data foundations for analytics at scale.*

- **Building enterprise semantic models**  
  Design unified, business-friendly data models that serve multiple reporting needs and reduce duplication.

- **Shared dataset lifecycle management**  
  Govern the creation, certification, retirement, and ownership of datasets used across teams and apps.

- **Integrating Power BI with CI/CD tools (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)**  
  Automate testing, validation, and deployment of reports and datasets through secure pipelines.

- **Continuous delivery for analytical products**  
  Treat dashboards and datasets as products—versioned, tested, and released with user feedback loops.

- **DevOps pipelines for Power BI deployments**  
  Structure promotion workflows (Dev → Test → Prod) with validation gates and rollback capabilities.

- **Designing data contracts between BI and data engineering**  
  Formalize agreements on schema, SLAs, refresh cadence, and error handling to reduce integration friction.

- **Enterprise-wide DAX pattern libraries**  
  Create and maintain a curated set of reusable, optimized, and documented DAX measures to ensure consistency.

### **3. Process and Delivery**  
*Aligning Agile execution with business value and cross-functional coordination.*

- **Agile backlog management for BI teams**  
  Prioritize user stories based on decision impact, data readiness, and effort—not just stakeholder requests.

- **Designing value streams for analytics**  
  Map end-to-end flows from business question to insight delivery to eliminate waste and handoff delays.

- **BI portfolio prioritization frameworks**  
  Use cost-of-delay, strategic alignment, or WSJF to objectively rank analytics initiatives.

- **Metrics for measuring BI team agility**  
  Track lead time, deployment frequency, change failure rate, and stakeholder satisfaction—not just story points.

- **Managing dependencies across BI and data engineering**  
  Visualize and coordinate work between squads using dependency boards, integration sprints, or API-first approaches.

- **BI maturity model**  
  Assess and evolve your organization across people, process, technology, and governance dimensions.

- **DataOps vs Agile BI**  
  Understand how DataOps principles (automation, monitoring, collaboration) complement and extend Agile BI practices.

### **4. Roles and Organizational Design**  
*Structuring teams and roles to maximize autonomy, accountability, and expertise.*

- **BI Center of Excellence (CoE) operating model**  
  Define the mission, services, and governance role of the CoE—enabler vs. gatekeeper.

- **Role of Data Product Managers in BI**  
  Position product managers as outcome owners who bridge business needs and technical delivery.

- **Cross-functional BI squads and roles**  
  Staff teams with analysts, modelers, engineers, and testers who collectively own end-to-end delivery.

- **Setting up a BI guild structure (Chapters, Tribes)**  
  Scale practices through communities of interest (e.g., DAX Guild, Visualization Guild) without central control.

- **Scrum of Scrums in analytics programs**  
  Coordinate multiple BI teams through regular syncs on dependencies, blockers, and shared standards.

### **5. Strategy and Alignment**  
*Ensuring BI transformation drives business outcomes and organizational change.*

- **Aligning BI delivery with OKRs and KPIs**  
  Connect every sprint to strategic objectives so analytics directly supports company priorities.

- **Balancing innovation and standardization in BI**  
  Allow experimentation in sandboxes while maintaining core standards for production assets.

- **Change management in BI transformation**  
  Address cultural resistance, skill gaps, and process shifts through communication, training, and quick wins.

- **Communication cadences for scaled BI programs**  
  Establish regular forums for leadership updates, team demos, and cross-squad learning.

- **Lessons learned from failed BI scaling initiatives**  
  Avoid common pitfalls: over-centralization, ignoring data culture, underestimating data debt, or tool-first thinking.

This structure moves logically from **foundational control** (Governance) → **technical execution** (Architecture) → **team workflow** (Process) → **people design** (Roles) → **business impact** (Strategy).  

It can serve as:  
- A **capability maturity roadmap**  
- A **training curriculum for BI leaders**  
- A **blueprint for your BI Center of Excellence**
