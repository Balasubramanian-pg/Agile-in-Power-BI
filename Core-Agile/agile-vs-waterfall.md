# Agile Vs Waterfall

**Agile Vs Waterfall**

**Project Approach & Philosophy**

*   **Agile**
    *   > [!TIP]
        > Agile is an iterative and flexible approach.
    *   Development is done in cycles (sprints).
    *   Welcomes and expects changes in requirements.
    *   Sees the project as a series of small, evolving steps.

*   **Waterfall**
    *   > [!NOTE]
        > Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach.
    *   Development flows downward through phases, like a waterfall.
    *   Requires fixed, detailed requirements at the start.
    *   Sees the project as one single, monolithic process.

**Process & Phases**

*   **Agile Process**
    *   Phases are concurrent and repeated every sprint.
    *   Planning, design, development, and testing happen in each cycle.
    *   The project scope is flexible and defined sprint-by-sprint.

*   **Waterfall Process**
    *   > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Phases are distinct and must be completed one after another.
    *   Sequential order: Requirements > Design > Implementation > Verification > Maintenance.
    *   You cannot easily go back to a previous phase.

**Handling Changes**

*   **Agile and Change**
    *   > [!TIP]
        > Changes can be incorporated at the start of each new sprint.
    *   Changes are considered a normal and valuable part of the process.
    *   Adapting to change is a core competitive advantage.

*   **Waterfall and Change**
    *   > [!CAUTION]
        > Changes are very difficult and expensive to implement once a phase is complete.
    *   Requires formal change control procedures and often renegotiation.
    *   Making changes can derail the entire project plan and timeline.

**Customer Involvement**

*   **Agile Customer Role**
    *   The customer or product owner is deeply involved throughout.
    *   They provide continuous feedback at the end of each sprint.
    *   Collaboration is continuous and crucial for success.

*   **Waterfall Customer Role**
> [!NOTE]
> Customer involvement is typically high at the beginning and end.
> They define requirements at the start and approve the product at the end.
> Limited interaction during the long development phase in the middle.

**Delivery Model**

*   **Agile Delivery**
    *   Delivers a working product increment at the end of each sprint.
    *   The product is built feature-by-feature, with the most valuable ones first.
    *   Allows for early ROI and market testing.

*   **Waterfall Delivery**
> [!CAUTION]
> The final product is delivered all at once at the very end of the project.
> The customer does not see a working product until the final phase.
> This carries higher risk if the delivered product does not meet user needs.

**Best Suited For**

*   **Agile is Best For**
    *   Projects with uncertain or rapidly changing requirements.
    *   Innovative products where the final outcome is not fully known.
    *   When early and frequent customer feedback is critical.

*   **Waterfall is Best For**
  > [!NOTE]
  > Projects with clear, fixed, and well-understood requirements.
  > Projects with strict regulatory or compliance requirements.
  > Simple, short projects where the process is predictable.
