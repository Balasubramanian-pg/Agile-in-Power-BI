# Agile Basics

**Core Philosophy & Mindset**

*   > [!TIP]
    > Agile is a mindset, not just a set of rules.
*   It values **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
    *   Communication within the team is the most effective method.
*   It prioritizes **working software** over comprehensive documentation.
    *   A working feature is more valuable than a lengthy specification document.
*   It focuses on **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
    *   The customer is involved throughout the project.
*   It embraces **responding to change** over following a plan.
    *   Change is seen as a competitive advantage, not a setback.

**The Agile Manifesto Principles**

*   > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Our highest priority is customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
*   Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
*   Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.
*   Business people and developers must work together daily.
*   > [!NOTE]
    > Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need.
*   The most efficient method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.
*   Working software is the primary measure of progress.
*   Sustainable development is crucial. The team should maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

**Key Agile Frameworks**

*   **Scrum**
    *   > [!TIP]
        > Scrum is a lightweight framework for complex projects.
    *   Uses fixed-length iterations called **Sprints** (usually 2-4 weeks).
    *   Key roles: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **Development Team**.
    *   Key events: **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Stand-up**, **Sprint Review**, and **Sprint Retrospective**.

*   **Kanban**
    *   > [!TIP]
        > Kanban focuses on visualizing work and limiting work-in-progress.
    *   Uses a **Kanban board** with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
    *   Helps manage flow and reduce bottlenecks.
    *   There are no fixed timeboxes; work is pulled as capacity allows.

**Common Agile Practices & Artifacts**

*   **User Stories**
    *   > [!NOTE]
        > A user story describes a software feature from an end-user perspective.
    *   Format: "As a [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [a reason]."

*   **Product Backlog**
    *   This is a prioritized list of everything needed in the product.
    *   It is managed by the Product Owner and is constantly evolving.

*   **Daily Stand-up Meeting**
    *   > [!IMPORTANT]
        > A daily, time-boxed 15-minute meeting for the team to synchronize.
    *   Each member answers: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any impediments?

*   **Sprint Retrospective**
    *   > [!NOTE]
        > A meeting held after a sprint to reflect on the process.
    *   The team discusses what went well, what could be improved, and creates a plan for improvements.

**Benefits of Agile**

*   > [!TIP]
    > Faster time to market with valuable features.
*   Increased flexibility and adaptability to change.
*   Higher product quality and customer satisfaction.
*   Improved team morale and project visibility.
*   > [!CAUTION]
    > Requires a significant cultural shift and discipline. It is not a silver bullet.
