# Agile Principles Powerbi

> [!TIP]
> Treat your Power BI project as a product, not a one-time report.
*   Deliver working Power BI content frequently.
    *   Release a simple, functional `.pbix` file early.
    *   Iterate and add features in small cycles.
*   Welcome changing business requirements.
    *   A new measure or visual request is an opportunity, not a failure.
*   Business users and developers must work together daily.
    *   Collaborate directly with report consumers.
    *   Get immediate feedback on dashboards and data models.

**Applying Principles to Power BI Workflow**

*   **Satisfy Users Through Early Delivery**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A basic report with correct data is better than a perfect report that's late.

*   Start with a single page and a few key visuals.
*   Deploy it to the Power BI Service for user testing quickly.

*   **Sustainable Development Pace**
> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid "death by a thousand measures." Build a maintainable data model.
*   Create a clean, well-documented data model in small steps.
*   Use consistent naming conventions for tables and measures.

*   **Working Software is the Primary Measure**
> [!NOTE]
> A published and refreshed Power BI report is your "working software."
*   Focus on delivering a refreshed dataset and a functional report.
*   This is more valuable than a complex project plan.

**Agile Frameworks in Power BI**

*   **Scrum for Power BI**
    *   Use **Sprints** to plan a set of reports, DAX measures, or data sources.
    *   **Product Owner** defines the business needs and prioritizes the "Backlog."
    *   **Scrum Master** helps remove blockers like data access or gateway issues.

*   **Kanban for Power BI**
> [!TIP]
> Use a Kanban board to manage ad-hoc requests and bug fixes.
*   Visualize your work: "To Do," "Data Modeling," "DAX & Visuals," "Testing," "Published."
*   Limit work-in-progress to avoid context switching.

**Key Power BI Artifacts & Practices**

*   **The Product Backlog**
    *   A prioritized list of all potential Power BI work.
    *   Includes new reports, data sources, DAX measures, and performance optimizations.

*   **User Stories for Power BI**
    *   "As a **Sales Manager**, I want **a visual of monthly sales vs. target** so that **I can track performance.**"
    *   "As a **Marketing Analyst**, I want **to filter customers by region and product** so that **I can analyze campaign effectiveness.**"

*   **Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Good design enhances agility. A messy data model is hard to change.
*   Regularly refactor and optimize DAX calculations.
*   Review and improve data model relationships for performance.
