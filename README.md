# **Agile-in-Power-BI: A Framework for Discipline and Delivery**

>[!NOTE]
>*Structure is not the enemy of creativity; it is its foundation. In the marriage of Agile and Power BI, we find the balance between rigor and adaptability—a system to turn data into truth, and truth into action.*

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized to **clarify, not complicate**. Each file is a **deliberate step** toward understanding how Agile principles **manifest in Power BI**—and how to articulate that understanding in interviews.

## File Breakdown: Truth Over Noise

### **1. README.md**
**Purpose:** *Why this repository exists—and why it matters.*
- **The Problem:** Agile in Power BI is often reduced to buzzwords. This repository **restores weight** to the principles.
- **The Solution:** A structured path to **mastery**, not just interview success.
- **How to Use It:** Navigate from philosophy (`Core-Agile/`) to practice (`PowerBI-Practices/`) to proof (`Interview-Prep/`).

---

### **2. Core-Agile/: The Bedrock**
#### **agile-basics.md**
**Truth:** Agile is not a methodology. It is a **moral commitment** to **clarity, adaptability, and responsibility**.
- **Iterative Work:** Small steps, **measured and corrected**.
- **Incremental Value:** Deliver **usable truth**, not perfect illusions.
- **Collaboration Over Silos:** The team **owns the outcome**—together.
- **Feedback as Discipline:** The market (or stakeholder) does not lie. **Listen.**

#### **agile-principles-powerbi.md**
**Truth:** Power BI is a tool. Agile is the **discipline** that prevents it from becoming a **weapon of chaos**.
- **Working Reports > Documentation:** A dashboard is **only valuable if it’s used**.
- **Quick Mock-Ups > False Precision:** Start with **honest approximations**, not polished deceit.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration:** KPIs are **not dictated**; they are **negotiated**.
- **Respond to Changing KPIs:** The world shifts. **Your dashboards must shift with it.**

#### **agile-vs-waterfall.md**
**Truth:** Waterfall is the **illusion of control**. Agile is the **practice of honesty**.
- **Waterfall:** “Plan everything, then pray.”
- **Agile:** “Plan enough to act, then **adapt as you learn**.”

### **3. Scrum-Framework/: The Architecture of Accountability**
#### **roles.md**
**Truth:** Roles are not titles. They are **responsibilities**.
- **Product Owner:** The **voice of truth** (what *must* be built).
- **Scrum Master:** The **guardian of discipline** (how it *will* be built).
- **Development Team:** The **builders of value** (who *actually* build it).
- **Stakeholders:** The **recipients of honesty** (why it matters).

#### **artifacts.md**
**Truth:** Artifacts are not paperwork. They are **mirrors of progress**.
- **Product Backlog:** The **single source of truth** for what matters.
- **Sprint Backlog:** The **commitment** for this cycle.
- **Increment:** The **proof** of work done.
- **User Story:** The **contract of clarity** (“As a [role], I need [value]”).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The **standard of honesty** (“Done” means *done*).

#### **ceremonies.md**
**Truth:** Ceremonies are not meetings. They are **rituals of alignment**.
- **Sprint Planning:** “What **must** we achieve?”
- **Daily Stand-Up:** “What **blocks** our progress?”
- **Sprint Review:** “What **value** did we deliver?”
- **Sprint Retrospective:** “What **truth** must we face?”

#### **metrics-measures.md**
**Truth:** Metrics are not vanity. They are **signals of discipline**.
- **Velocity:** Not a goal—**a diagnostic**.
- **Burndown Chart:** The **mirror of progress**.
- **Lead Time/Cycle Time:** How fast can we **deliver truth**?

### **4. PowerBI-Practices/: Where Principle Meets Pixel**
#### **agile-practices-bi.md**
**Truth:** Power BI is **not just a tool**. It is a **test of Agile discipline**.
- **Prototype Fast:** Build **honest drafts**, not perfect lies.
- **Dummy Data:** Start with **structure**, not noise.
- **Frequent Feedback:** Show early, **learn faster**.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Improve **relentlessly**.
- **Prioritize KPIs:** Not all metrics are equal. **Focus on what matters**.
- **Avoid Gold-Plating:** “Done” is **better than “perfect.”**
- **CI/CD in Power BI Service:** **Automate honesty**.
- **Version Control:** **Track truth**, not just changes.

#### **challenges.md**
**Truth:** Agile in Power BI is **hard**. That’s why it’s **worth doing**.
- **Data Engineering Dependencies:** You are **not an island**.
- **Unclear KPI Ownership:** If no one owns the metric, **no one owns the truth**.
- **Speed vs. Governance:** Move fast, but **do not break trust**.
- **PBIX Version Control:** **Chaos is the default**. Discipline is the choice.
- **Data Accuracy:** Fast cycles **demand rigor**, not excuses.

#### **scaling-agile-bi.md**
**Truth:** Scaling Agile is not about size. It’s about **alignment**.
- **Program Increment Planning:** Multiple teams, **one truth**.
- **Enterprise Data Strategy:** Agile teams **must** align with the **bigger picture**.
- **Backlog Grooming:** **Clarity is a team sport**.
- **Shared Datasets:** **One source of truth**, not ten.

#### **mapping-values-powerbi.md**
**Truth:** The Agile Manifesto was written for **all builders of value**—including Power BI practitioners.
- **Individuals & Interactions > Processes & Tools:** **People build dashboards**, not software.
- **Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation:** A **usable dashboard** is worth a thousand slides.
- **Customer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation:** KPIs are **co-created**, not dictated.
- **Responding to Change > Following a Plan:** Dashboards **must evolve**—or they die.

### **5. Interview-Prep/: The Test of Clarity**
#### **Questions/interview-questions.md**
**Truth:** Interviews are not about **right answers**. They are about **clear thinking**.
- What is the **difference between Agile and Scrum**?
- Explain **user stories**—with a Power BI example.
- What is a **sprint**? Why 2–4 weeks?
- How do you handle **changing requirements mid-sprint**?
- Why does **backlog refinement** matter?
- **Increment vs. Prototype**: What’s the **real difference**?
- How does **testing/QA** work in BI?
- How do you measure **Agile success** beyond velocity?
- How do you manage **dependencies** in Power BI?
- How do you **balance technical debt** with speed?

#### **Answers/interview-answers.md**
**Truth:** Answers must be **structured, honest, and concise**.
- Use the **STAR method** for scenarios:
  - **Situation:** “We faced [chaos].”
  - **Task:** “Our responsibility was [clarity].”
  - **Action:** “We chose [discipline].”
  - **Result:** “We delivered [value].”
- For technical questions: **Define → Example → Why It Matters**.

## **Closing Reflection**
This repository is **not just for interviews**. It is a **framework for discipline**—a way to **build Power BI solutions with integrity, adapt with honesty, and deliver value with clarity**.

**The test is not whether you can recite Agile.**
**The test is whether you can *live* it.**
