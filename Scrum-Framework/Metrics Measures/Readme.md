# Metrics & Measures in Agile

### Velocity
> [!NOTE]
> A planning tool measuring the amount of work a team can complete in a sprint.
*   Calculated by summing story points of completed backlog items.
*   Used for forecasting future sprint capacity.
*   Should be tracked as a range or average, not a target.

### Sprint Burndown Chart
> [!TIP]
> Tracks the remaining work in the sprint backlog against time.
*   Shows ideal work remaining versus actual work remaining.
*   Helps team see if they are on track to complete sprint goal.
*   Gives early warning of potential scope or deadline issues.

### Release Burndown Chart
*   Tracks remaining work across multiple sprints toward a release.
*   Shows progress toward completing the product backlog.
*   Helps Product Owners with release planning and forecasting.

### Cycle Time
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Measures time from when work starts until it's delivered.
*   Key metric for flow efficiency and process improvement.
*   Shorter cycle times indicate faster value delivery.
*   Helps identify bottlenecks in development process.

### Lead Time
*   Measures time from customer request until delivery.
*   Includes wait time before work begins.
*   Important for managing customer expectations.

### Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)
> [!CAUTION]
> Visualizes work status across different stages over time.
*   Shows work in progress (WIP) limits effectiveness.
*   Reveals bottlenecks where work piles up.
*   Helps maintain smooth workflow.

## Quality Metrics

### Definition of Done (DoD) Adherence
*   Tracks how often completed items meet all done criteria.
*   Ensures consistent quality standards.
*   Prevents technical debt accumulation.

### Escaped Defects
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Counts defects found in production after feature completion.
*   Measures quality from customer perspective.
*   Helps improve testing and quality assurance processes.

### Code Coverage
*   Measures percentage of code exercised by automated tests.
*   Indicates test suite comprehensiveness.
*   Should be balanced with test quality.

## Team Health & Process Metrics

### Sprint Goal Success Rate
> [!NOTE]
> Tracks how often teams achieve their sprint goals.
*   Measures planning accuracy and execution capability.
*   Reflects team's ability to manage scope and dependencies.

### Team Happiness
*   Regular surveys or check-ins on team morale.
*   Correlates strongly with productivity and quality.
*   Early indicator of burnout or process issues.

### Retrospective Action Item Follow-through
*   Tracks completion of improvement items from retrospectives.
*   Measures continuous improvement effectiveness.
*   Ensures feedback leads to meaningful change.
