# README: The Moral Order of the Agile Artifacts

## Introduction

Every Agile team lives and dies by the discipline of its artifacts. They are not mere files; they are **structures of accountability**. In Power BI or any digital craft, chaos is not far away — requirements multiply, sprints blur, ownership diffuses. These artifacts stand as the guardrails between momentum and disarray.

When properly maintained, they give the team clarity, rhythm, and direction. When ignored, entropy creeps in. You must treat each artifact not as a document to be filled, but as a moral obligation to the truth of your work.

## 1.1 Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is the **manifestation of vision meeting reality**.
It is the single, prioritized list of everything that could be built — all hopes, all requests, all temptations. The Product Owner is its custodian, but the team must constantly challenge and refine it.

To neglect the backlog is to lose sight of purpose. To overfill it is to deceive yourself with false ambition. Keep it lean, current, and painfully honest.

## 1.2 Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is the **commitment of the present**.
It says, “This is what we will do now, and we will do it fully.” Each item represents a promise. Breaking it casually corrodes trust, and trust is the currency of agility.

This artifact teaches restraint. You cannot do everything. So, choose carefully — and deliver relentlessly.

## 1.3 Increment

The Increment is the **truth revealed**. It is the working output that proves your process has meaning.
All discussion, estimation, and ceremony culminate here — a published Power BI report, a working dashboard, a refreshed dataset that tells the story of progress.

If the Increment doesn’t exist, the rest is performance. It is not talk, but evidence, that makes you credible.

## 1.4 Definition of Done (DoD)

The Definition of Done is the **moral contract** of the team. It defines what “finished” truly means. Without it, you invite ambiguity, and ambiguity is where mediocrity hides.

Done means tested. Done means reviewed. Done means usable by someone who is not you.
A vague “done” breeds excuses. A precise one breeds mastery.

---

## 1.5 Product Goal

The Product Goal is **the horizon** — the unifying purpose toward which all sprints march.
It binds short-term effort to long-term meaning. Without it, every sprint risks becoming an isolated burst of activity, devoid of direction.

Hold this goal clearly in view. Let it evolve as understanding deepens, but never let it vanish.
A team without a Product Goal is busy, not productive.

## Closing Reflection

These five artifacts form the **moral architecture of Agile practice**. They are not paperwork; they are promises. They protect clarity, foster trust, and ensure that progress is not illusion.

Treat them with respect. Keep them updated. Challenge them often.
Because in the end, Agile isn’t about speed — it’s about truth.
