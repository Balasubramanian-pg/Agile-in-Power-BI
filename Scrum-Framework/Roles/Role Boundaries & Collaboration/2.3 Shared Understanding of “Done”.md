# **The Discipline of a Shared Understanding of “Done” in Power BI Projects**

<details><summary><strong>Introduction</strong></summary>

Power BI delivery collapses when completion is defined loosely or inconsistently.
A shared understanding of “Done” creates the structure that prevents incomplete logic, unvalidated visuals, or unstable models from reaching stakeholders.
It anchors the team to a common standard of truth and quality.

“Done” is not an aesthetic judgment.
It is a disciplined commitment to accuracy, coherence, and responsibility.
This shared understanding protects the team from the illusion of progress and the erosion of trust.

<details><summary><strong>Clarity of Criteria</strong></summary>

A team aligns when “Done” is articulated clearly.
Ambiguity produces rework; precision prevents it.

Criteria include validated data, tested measures, consistent definitions, and predictable behavior across scenarios.
The team documents these expectations so no member interprets completion differently.
Clarity transforms completion into a verifiable state rather than a subjective feeling.

<details><summary><strong>Validation Against Business Logic</strong></summary>

Technical correctness is insufficient without alignment to business truth.
“Done” requires that every measure, relationship, and visual reflect real operational meaning.

The team checks definitions with stakeholders.
They verify assumptions behind KPIs and thresholds.
They ensure that interpretation matches intention.

This validation prevents analytical narratives from drifting away from reality.

<details><summary><strong>Functional Stability</strong></summary>

A report is incomplete until it behaves reliably.

Filters operate as expected.
Navigation flows smoothly.
Edge cases are tested, not ignored.
Performance meets reasonable thresholds for practical use.

Stability ensures that users can trust what they see and how they interact with it.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Consistency Across the Solution</strong></summary>

Completion includes conformity to established patterns.
A Power BI project weakens when each element follows its own logic or structure.

Naming conventions align.
Formatting adheres to standards.
Models follow agreed patterns for relationships and granularity.

Consistency reinforces clarity across the entire analytical ecosystem.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Usability and Narrative Coherence</strong></summary>

A technically correct report can still fail if it cannot communicate meaning.
“Done” requires that the visual story is comprehensible, intentional, and purposeful.

The team evaluates whether the design supports decision-making.
They remove clutter that obscures insight.
They ensure that users can follow the narrative without confusion.

Coherence transforms data into understanding.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Documented and Review-Ready</strong></summary>

Completion is not private; it is shared.
A “Done” item must be transparent and reviewable.

Acceptance criteria are met.
Assumptions are documented.
Known limitations are stated honestly.

Documentation ensures that work can be understood, challenged, and sustained.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Closing Reflection</strong></summary>

A shared definition of “Done” disciplines the entire Power BI team.
It aligns expectations, eliminates ambiguity, and anchors the work to standards that protect truth and usability.
When “Done” is defined collectively and upheld consistently, the team gains stability and the organization gains insight it can rely on.
