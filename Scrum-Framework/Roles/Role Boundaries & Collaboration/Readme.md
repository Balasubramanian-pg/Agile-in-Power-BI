# The Discipline of Role Boundaries & Collaboration

## Introduction

Agile fails fastest when roles blur.
Each role — Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer — exists to balance the others. When boundaries collapse, accountability disappears: Product Owners start managing tasks, Scrum Masters start managing people, and developers become order-takers instead of problem-solvers.
Clarity is not rigidity; it’s the structure that allows collaboration to stay honest.

## PO vs. SM: Clear Distinctions

The **Product Owner** defines *what* brings value. The **Scrum Master** ensures *how* it’s delivered is sustainable. They are two sides of one system — value and velocity.

**Product Owner:**

* Owns the backlog and prioritization.
* Engages with stakeholders and translates business need into actionable user stories.
* Defines the *why* and *what*, never the *how*.

**Scrum Master:**

* Protects the process, not the scope.
* Enforces time-boxes, coaches the team, and removes impediments.
* Guards against the PO turning the backlog into a command list.

When the PO manages tasks or the SM prioritizes backlog items, accountability collapses.
Each must respect the boundary — not for bureaucracy’s sake, but to preserve focus and fairness.

## Development Team Accountability

The **Development Team** owns execution. They estimate, plan, and deliver within their commitments.
Their power lies in autonomy; their credibility lies in follow-through.

**Core principles:**

* They commit to the Sprint Goal, not individual tasks.
* They decide *how* to achieve it — sequence, division of work, and technical design.
* They surface blockers, not excuses.

Micromanagement destroys ownership. True accountability emerges when the team’s word carries weight — when they say “we’ll do it,” and do.

## Shared Understanding of “Done”

The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is the contract that unites every role.
It defines quality, completeness, and releasability — removing ambiguity about when work is truly finished.

**All roles contribute:**

* **Product Owner:** Ensures business acceptance criteria are embedded.
* **Scrum Master:** Enforces adherence and prevents shortcuts.
* **Developers:** Implement and validate against it every sprint.

A shared DoD creates trust. It means no hidden rework, no false finishes, and no debates at review time.
When “done” means the same thing to everyone, the team moves as one.

## Closing Reflection

Clear boundaries create strong collaboration.
The Product Owner sets direction, the Scrum Master maintains rhythm, and the Developers make it real.

When each role honors its lane while serving the collective goal, agility stops being fragile — it becomes **coherence in motion**.
