# **The Discipline of the Scrum Master as Team Administrator in Power BI Projects**

<details><summary><strong>Introduction</strong></summary>

Power BI teams often inherit expectations from traditional project environments.
This leads some organizations to treat the Scrum Master as an administrator or project manager.
While the role includes coordination, its deeper purpose is to preserve process integrity and protect the team from disorder.

Administrative work becomes necessary, but it must not overshadow the Scrum Master’s responsibility to maintain rhythm, transparency, and disciplined collaboration.
Their contribution is structural, not bureaucratic.

The Scrum Master handles essential operational tasks, but this support remains grounded in service rather than authority.

They schedule ceremonies.
They maintain sprint boards and artifacts.
They ensure documentation is accessible and updated.

This work organizes the environment, not the people.
Administration becomes a means to enable clarity rather than impose control.

Scrum Mastery emphasizes enabling flow.

Their influence lies in shaping how decisions move through the team.
