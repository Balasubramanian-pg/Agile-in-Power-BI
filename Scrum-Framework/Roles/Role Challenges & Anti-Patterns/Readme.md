# The Discipline of Role Challenges & Anti-Patterns

## Introduction

Agile roles are meant to distribute clarity, not confusion. Yet, in most teams, roles are the first thing to warp under pressure.
When boundaries blur and accountability drifts, the process becomes theater — titles without ownership, ceremonies without purpose.
Understanding the anti-patterns is how teams defend the integrity of their craft.

## Proxy Product Owner

When the **Product Owner** is absent or too busy, organizations often install a *proxy* — a Business Analyst, Scrum Master, or mid-layer manager who “represents the PO.” It seems harmless. It isn’t.

**Risks:**

* Decisions slow or loop endlessly between proxy and actual PO.
* Backlog items lose connection to real customer value.
* The team starts optimizing for internal convenience rather than market need.

**Remedy:**

* The true PO must remain accountable for prioritization and outcome, even if support roles help with refinement.
* Use delegation boards or explicit authority boundaries to clarify what can be decided locally.

You can delegate work, but not responsibility. A proxy can carry information, not vision.

## Scrum Master as Team Admin or Project Manager

The **Scrum Master** is often mistaken for a coordinator — someone who books rooms, records notes, and reminds people of deadlines.
That’s not facilitation; that’s clerical work disguised as leadership.

**Symptoms:**

* SM runs every meeting but asks no coaching questions.
* The team reports *to* the SM instead of working *through* them.
* Status tracking replaces process improvement.

**Remedy:**

* Anchor the Scrum Master’s purpose: enable self-organization, remove impediments, and develop team capability.
* If they spend more time updating spreadsheets than improving flow, the role has lost its meaning.

The Scrum Master is a mirror, not a manager. Their power lies in reflection, not control.

## “Team of Specialists” vs. Cross-Functional Reality

Many teams claim to be cross-functional but behave like silos under one logo.
There’s one DAX expert, one tester, one data modeler — and everyone waits for them.
Velocity looks fine on paper, but flow collapses when any single specialist is unavailable.

**Challenges:**

* Knowledge hoarding creates fragility.
* Work piles behind bottlenecks, hiding under “in progress.”
* Collaboration becomes dependency, not partnership.

**Remedy:**

* Foster *skill overlap*: pair programming, peer reviews, documentation of recurring tasks.
* Rotate roles occasionally — let developers write tests, let analysts build small visuals.
* Value learning capacity over title protection.

A truly cross-functional team isn’t one where everyone does everything; it’s one where nothing stops because one person is missing.

## Closing Reflection

Role challenges are rarely about people — they’re about courage and clarity.
It’s easier to act like a proxy than to demand vision, easier to coordinate than to coach, easier to specialize than to share.

But Agile’s strength lies in collective ownership — every role distinct, yet deeply interdependent.
Guard that balance, or the framework becomes form without force.
