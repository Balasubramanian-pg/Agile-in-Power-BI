# **The Discipline of the Proxy Product Owner in Power BI Projects**

<details><summary><strong>Introduction</strong></summary>

A Proxy Product Owner emerges when the distance between stakeholders and the development team threatens clarity.
In Power BI projects, this intermediary role carries weight because analytics work depends on stable definitions, timely decisions, and precise interpretation.
The proxy ensures continuity when the primary Product Owner cannot participate fully, protecting the team from ambiguity and drift.

This role is not a substitute for authority.
It is a disciplined extension of it, anchored in service to both business intent and delivery integrity.
