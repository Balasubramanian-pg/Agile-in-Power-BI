# Artifacts in Agile

**Product Backlog**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The single, authoritative source for everything a product needs.
*   A prioritized list of all desired work on the product.
*   Contains user stories, features, bug fixes, and technical tasks.
*   Constantly evolving and refined by the Product Owner.
*   Never complete; the top is more detailed than the bottom.

**Sprint Backlog**
> [!NOTE]
> The set of Product Backlog items selected for the current Sprint.
*   Created by the Development Team during Sprint Planning.
*   Includes a plan for delivering the increment and achieving the Sprint Goal.
*   Is a highly visible, real-time picture of the team's work.
*   Owned and managed by the Development Team.

**Increment**
> [!TIP]
> The sum of all completed Product Backlog items during a Sprint.
*   Must be in a "Done" state and meet the team's Definition of Done.
*   Is additive to all previous increments.
*   Must be in a usable condition, regardless of the Product Owner's decision to release it.
*   The primary measure of progress.

**Scrum-Specific Artifacts**

**Definition of Done (DoD)**
> [!CAUTION]
> A formal description of the state of an Increment when it meets quality measures.
*   A shared understanding within the Scrum Team of what it means for work to be complete.
*   Prevents technical debt and ensures a releasable increment.
*   Examples include: "Code is reviewed, tested, and deployed to staging."

**Product Goal**
*   Describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.
*   The Product Backlog is the emerging plan to achieve the Product Goal.
*   Gives the team long-term focus and direction.

**Other Common Agile Artifacts**

**User Stories**
> [!NOTE]
> Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the user.
*   Format: "As a [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [a reason]."
*   Are the primary method of expressing needs in the Product Backlog.

**Burndown Chart**
*   A graphic representation of work left to do versus time.
*   Shows the trend of remaining effort in the Sprint or for a release.
*   Helps teams predict if they will complete their work by the end of the timebox.

**Task Board / Kanban Board**
> [!TIP]
> A visual representation of the state of work in a process.
*   Columns typically include: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
*   Makes workflow and bottlenecks transparent to the entire team.
