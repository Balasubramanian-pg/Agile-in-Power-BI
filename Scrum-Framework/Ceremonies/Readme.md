*   **Sprint Planning**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The entire Scrum team collaborates to plan the work for the upcoming Sprint.
*   Time-boxed to a maximum of 8 hours for a one-month Sprint.
*   The team answers two key questions:
    *   What can be delivered in this Sprint?
    *   How will the chosen work be achieved?
*   Outputs are the Sprint Goal and the Sprint Backlog.

*   **Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)**
> [!NOTE]
> A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize.
*   Held at the same time and place every working day.
*   Each team member answers:
    *   What did I do yesterday?
    *   What will I do today?
    *   Are there any impediments?
*   Focus is on progress toward the Sprint Goal, not detailed problem-solving.

*   **Sprint Review**
> [!TIP]
> Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog.
*   Time-boxed to a maximum of 4 hours for a one-month Sprint.
*   The Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate on what to do next.
*   The Development Team demonstrates the work that was "Done".
*   Informal; not a status meeting, but a working session.

*   **Sprint Retrospective**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements.
*   Time-boxed to a maximum of 3 hours for a one-month Sprint.
*   Occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning.
*   The team discusses:
    *   What went well during the Sprint?
    *   What could be improved?
    *   How will we implement these improvements?

**Purpose of Ceremonies**

*   **Create Regular Rhythm**
> [!NOTE]
> Ceremonies provide a predictable cadence for inspection and adaptation.
*   They ensure consistent communication and feedback loops.
*   They break down complex work into manageable cycles.

*   **Ensure Transparency**
*   Each ceremony makes progress, problems, and plans visible to everyone.
*   They foster a culture of collective responsibility and shared understanding.
