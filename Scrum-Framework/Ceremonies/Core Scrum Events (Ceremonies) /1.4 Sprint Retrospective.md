# Sprint Retrospective

## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1. Definition and Purpose

*   **What is a Sprint Retrospective?**
    *   The Sprint Retrospective is an event that concludes the Sprint.
    *   It is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.
    *   It is one of the five official events of the Scrum framework.

*   **Primary Goals:**
    *   **Inspect the Sprint:** The team reflects on the past Sprint regarding individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
    *   **Identify Improvements:** The team identifies and orders the major items that went well and potential improvements.
    *   **Create an Action Plan:** The team creates a plan for implementing improvements to how the Scrum Team performs its work.
    *   **Enhance Quality and Effectiveness:** The ultimate goal is to increase the team's overall quality and effectiveness.

> [!NOTE]
> The Sprint Retrospective focuses on the *process*, not the *product*. The Sprint Review is the event to inspect the product increment. The Retrospective is about how the team works together.

### 1.2. Key Characteristics

*   **Timing:**
    *   Occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning.
    *   It is the final event of the Sprint.

*   **Time-box:**
    *   For a one-month Sprint, the Retrospective is typically time-boxed to a maximum of three hours.
    *   For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter (e.g., 1.5 hours for a two-week Sprint).

*   **Participants:**
    *   **The Entire Scrum Team:** This includes the Developers, the Scrum Master, and the Product Owner.
    *   The Scrum Master facilitates the event to ensure it is positive and productive.
    *   All members are expected to participate as equals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The presence of the entire Scrum Team is crucial. The Retrospective is about the team's collective process, and every perspective is valuable for identifying meaningful improvements.

## 2. Structure of a Sprint Retrospective

*   A common and effective structure for a retrospective follows five stages, designed to guide the team through reflection and action planning.

### 2.1. Set the Stage

*   **Purpose:** To get everyone present and ready to participate. Create a safe and open environment.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Welcome everyone and state the purpose of the meeting.
    *   Review the agenda and the time-box.
    *   Conduct a brief icebreaker or check-in activity to help people focus (e.g., "describe the Sprint in one word").
    *   Reiterate the "Prime Directive."

> [!NOTE]
> **The Retrospective Prime Directive (by Norm Kerth):**
> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."
> This sets a positive, blameless tone for the meeting.

### 2.2. Gather Data

*   **Purpose:** To create a shared picture of what happened during the Sprint from everyone's perspective.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Timeline Creation:** The team collaboratively builds a timeline of the Sprint, marking significant events, successes, and frustrations.
    *   **Mad Sad Glad:** Team members write notes on what made them feel mad, sad, or glad during the Sprint.
    *   **Sailboat/Speedboat:** A visual metaphor where the team identifies anchors (what slowed them down), the wind (what pushed them forward), and the island (the Sprint Goal).

### 2.3. Generate Insights

*   **Purpose:** To analyze the data gathered, identify patterns, and understand the root causes of issues.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Dot Voting:** Team members vote on the items they feel are most important to discuss.
    *   **Group and Affinity Map:** Similar items are grouped together to identify themes or patterns.
    *   **The 5 Whys:** A root cause analysis technique where the team repeatedly asks "Why?" to get to the core of a problem.

### 2.4. Decide What to Do

*   **Purpose:** To create concrete, actionable improvement items.
*   **Activities:**
    *   **Brainstorming Solutions:** The team brainstorms potential solutions for the highest-priority issues identified.
    *   **SMART Goals:** Create improvement goals that are **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound.
    *   **Circle of Influence:** The team focuses on creating actions for things they can actually control or influence.

> [!TIP]
> Limit the number of action items. It's better to choose one or two high-impact improvements and execute them well than to create a long list that gets ignored.

### 2.5. Close the Retrospective

*   **Purpose:** To summarize the meeting, clarify the action plan, and appreciate the team's effort.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Review the action items, assign owners, and decide how they will be tracked.
    *   Conduct a "return on time invested" check (e.g., ask everyone to rate the meeting from 1 to 5).
    *   Thank everyone for their participation and insights.

## 3. Common Retrospective Techniques

*   **What Went Well, What Didn’t, What to Improve:**
    *   A simple and direct format with three columns.
    *   Team members write sticky notes for each category.
    *   It's a good starting point for new teams.

*   **Starfish Retrospective:**
    *   A more nuanced format with five categories:
        *   **Keep Doing:** Things that are working well and should be continued.
        *   **More Of:** Things that are working, and the team would benefit from doing more of them.
        *   **Less Of:** Things that are not providing much value or are causing problems.
        *   **Stop Doing:** Things that are clearly detrimental and should be stopped.
        *   **Start Doing:** New ideas or experiments the team wants to try.

*   **4Ls: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For:**
    *   **Liked:** What did the team enjoy about the Sprint?
    *   **Learned:** What new things did the team discover?
    *   **Lacked:** What did the team wish they had during the Sprint?
    *   **Longed For:** What does the team desire for the future?

## 4. Best Practices for an Effective Sprint Retrospective

*   **Create Psychological Safety:**
    *   Ensure a blameless environment where team members feel safe to share their honest opinions without fear of punishment or embarrassment.
    *   The Scrum Master plays a key role in fostering this safety.

*   **Focus on Process, Not People:**
    *   The conversation should be about improving the team's processes, tools, and collaboration, not about assigning blame to individuals.

*   **Make it Action-Oriented:**
    *   The primary output should be a small set of actionable improvement items for the next Sprint. Without this, the retrospective becomes just a talking session with no real impact.

*   **Add Improvements to the Sprint Backlog:**
    *   To ensure they are visible and get done, the most impactful improvement items from the Retrospective should be added to the Sprint Backlog for the upcoming Sprint.

*   **Vary the Format:**
    *   Using the same format every time can lead to "retrospective fatigue." The Scrum Master should introduce new techniques to keep the meeting fresh and engaging.

*   **Review Past Action Items:**
    *   Start the retrospective by reviewing the action items from the previous one to check their status and effectiveness. This builds accountability.

> [!WARNING]
> If the team identifies improvements but management does not support their implementation, the retrospective process will quickly be seen as pointless, leading to disengagement.

## 5. Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

*   **Blame Game:**
    *   **Symptom:** Team members point fingers at each other for failures.
    *   **Avoidance:** Reinforce the Prime Directive. The facilitator should guide the conversation back to processes and systemic issues rather than individual faults.

*   **No Action Items:**
    *   **Symptom:** The meeting ends with a good discussion but no concrete plan for improvement.
    *   **Avoidance:** Always dedicate the last part of the meeting to creating specific and actionable improvement items.

*   **Ignoring Action Items:**
    *   **Symptom:** Action items are created but are never implemented or followed up on.
    *   **Avoidance:** Add the action items to the next Sprint Backlog to make them a visible part of the team's work. Assign owners to each item.

*   **Managerial Attendance:**
    *   **Symptom:** A manager (who is not part of the Scrum Team) attends and influences the discussion, making team members hesitant to be open.
    *   **Avoidance:** The Scrum Master should explain to management the importance of the retrospective being a safe space for the team and that their presence can be counterproductive.

*   **Rushing the Meeting:**
    *   **Symptom:** The team rushes through the retrospective because they see it as a formality or a waste of time.
    *   **Avoidance:** The Scrum Master should help the team see the value by facilitating effectively and ensuring that real, impactful improvements come out of the meeting.

> [!CAUTION]
> Skipping the Sprint Retrospective is a major red flag in a Scrum implementation. It removes the team's dedicated opportunity to inspect and adapt its process, which is a core pillar of empiricism and continuous improvement.
