# Daily Scrum (Stand-up)

## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1. Definition and Purpose

*   **What is a Daily Scrum?**
    *   A short, daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
    *   It's one of the five official events of the Scrum framework.
    *   The purpose is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary.

*   **Alternative Names:**
    *   Daily Stand-up
    *   Daily Huddle

*   **Primary Goals:**
    *   **Inspect Progress:** The team checks its progress toward the Sprint Goal.
    *   **Adapt the Plan:** Based on the inspection, the team adjusts the plan for the upcoming day's work.
    *   **Improve Communication:** It serves as a key communication and coordination point for the team.
    *   **Identify Impediments:** Team members raise any obstacles that are hindering their progress.
    *   **Promote Quick Decision-Making:** The focused nature of the meeting encourages rapid decisions to keep work flowing.

> [!NOTE]
> The Daily Scrum is a planning meeting for the Developers, not a status meeting for stakeholders or managers. Its focus is on the team's collective progress towards the Sprint Goal.

### 1.2. Key Characteristics

*   **Time-boxed:**
    *   Strictly limited to 15 minutes.
    *   This keeps the meeting focused and efficient.

*   **Frequency and Consistency:**
    *   Held every working day of the Sprint.
    *   Occurs at the same time and place to reduce complexity and establish a routine.

*   **Participants:**
    *   **The Developers:** The Daily Scrum is an event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.
    *   **Scrum Master:** Ensures the event takes place and that the team keeps it within the 15-minute timebox, but they do not run the meeting. The Scrum Master can also coach the team on how to conduct an effective Daily Scrum.
    *   **Product Owner:** Can participate if they are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, otherwise their attendance is not mandatory but can be valuable.
    *   **Stakeholders:** May attend but should not participate unless invited by the Developers, as their presence can change the dynamic from collaboration to reporting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Developers are responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. It is a meeting for them, by them, to help them self-manage their work.

## 2. The Three Questions (Traditional Approach)

*   While no longer mandated by the Scrum Guide, the three questions are a common structure for the Daily Scrum.

*   **The Questions:**
    *   **What did I accomplish yesterday?** This helps the team understand the progress made towards the Sprint Goal.
    *   **What will I do today?** This provides transparency on the upcoming work and helps in coordination.
    *   **What is blocking my progress?** This surfaces any impediments that need to be addressed.

*   **Purpose of the Questions:**
    *   To provide a simple structure for sharing relevant information quickly.
    *   To focus the conversation on progress and obstacles.

> [!TIP]
> Answering these questions should be directed to the other team members, not just the Scrum Master or a manager. This fosters a sense of shared ownership and accountability.

## 3. Alternative Approaches and Formats

*   **Walking the Board:**
    *   Instead of each person giving an update, the team discusses the work item by item, typically starting from the ones closest to completion.
    *   This approach focuses the conversation on the flow of work and helps identify bottlenecks.
    *   It encourages a more collaborative discussion about the work itself, rather than individual contributions.

*   **Focusing on the Sprint Goal:**
    *   The conversation is centered around what the team can do to make progress on the Sprint Goal.
    *   This helps to ensure that all activities are aligned with the overall objective of the Sprint.

*   **Varying the Format:**
    *   Some teams find it beneficial to switch up the format to keep the meeting engaging. For instance, passing a token to determine who speaks next can increase engagement.

> [!NOTE]
> The key is to find a format that works best for the team and helps them achieve the purpose of the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Guide allows for flexibility in the structure and techniques used.

## 4. Best Practices for an Effective Daily Scrum

### 4.1. Preparation and Mindset

*   **Come Prepared:** Team members should think about their updates before the meeting to keep them concise and relevant.
*   **Focus on Collaboration:** The Daily Scrum is a team synchronization meeting, not a status report to a manager. The mindset should be one of "how can we as a team achieve our goal?".
*   **Respect the Timebox:** Everyone is responsible for keeping the meeting within the 15-minute time limit.

### 4.2. During the Meeting

*   **Start and End on Time:** Punctuality is crucial to respect everyone's time and maintain the rhythm of the Sprint.
*   **Use a Visual Board:** Gathering around a physical or digital task board can help focus the discussion on the work items and their status.
*   **Active Listening:** Pay attention to what other team members are saying to understand their progress, challenges, and how your work might be related.
*   **Defer Problem-Solving:** If a detailed discussion is needed to resolve an impediment, it should happen after the Daily Scrum with only the necessary people involved. This is often referred to as the "16th minute."
*   **Parking Lot:** Use a "parking lot" to note down topics that need further discussion outside of the Daily Scrum.

### 4.3. Post-Meeting

*   **Address Impediments:** The Scrum Master is responsible for helping to remove any impediments that were raised.
*   **Follow-up Conversations:** The relevant team members should have the detailed discussions that were deferred from the main meeting.

> [!TIP]
> To keep the meeting from becoming a status report, Scrum Masters can avoid taking notes and making direct eye contact with the person speaking. This encourages team members to address the whole team.

## 5. Daily Scrum vs. Daily Stand-up

*   **Relationship:** While the terms are often used interchangeably, there are some distinctions. The Daily Scrum is a specific event within the Scrum framework with defined rules and purpose. A "stand-up" is a more general term for a short, daily meeting and may not adhere to all the principles of a Daily Scrum.

*   **Key Differences:**
    | **Aspect** | **Daily Scrum** | **Daily Stand-up (General)** |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **Framework** | Prescribed event in the Scrum framework. | Not tied to a specific framework; can be used in various methodologies. |
    | **Purpose** | To inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal and adapt the plan. | Often used for status updates for managers or team leads. |
    | **Participants** | Primarily for the Developers. | Can include managers, team leads, and other stakeholders. |
    | **Timebox** | Strictly 15 minutes. | Time can be more flexible, though brevity is encouraged. |
    | **Frequency** | Every working day of the Sprint. | Can be daily, weekly, or as needed by the organization. |

> [!CAUTION]
> A common anti-pattern is for a Daily Scrum to devolve into a status meeting, where team members are simply reporting their progress to a manager rather than collaborating with their peers.

## 6. Common Anti-Patterns and How to Avoid Them

*   **The Daily Scrum as a Status Meeting:**
    *   **Symptom:** Team members report to the Scrum Master or Product Owner instead of communicating with each other.
    *   **Avoidance:** The Scrum Master should facilitate the meeting to be a conversation among the Developers and emphasize that it is their meeting.

*   **Problem-Solving During the Meeting:**
    *   **Symptom:** The team gets into lengthy technical discussions, exceeding the 15-minute timebox.
    *   **Avoidance:** Use the "parking lot" technique and schedule follow-up meetings for detailed problem-solving.

*   **Ignoring the Sprint Goal:**
    *   **Symptom:** The discussion is a series of disconnected individual updates with no reference to the overall Sprint Goal.
    *   **Avoidance:** The Scrum Master can help by starting or ending the meeting with a reminder of the Sprint Goal.

*   **Lack of Engagement:**
    *   **Symptom:** Team members are disengaged, giving robotic answers, or not actively listening.
    *   **Avoidance:** Vary the format of the meeting, use a physical token to indicate who speaks next, and ensure everyone understands the value of the event.

*   **Skipping the Daily Scrum:**
    *   **Symptom:** The team skips the meeting, believing it's unnecessary.
    *   **Avoidance:** The Scrum Master should educate the team on the importance of this daily synchronization point for maintaining alignment and addressing issues early.

> [!WARNING]
> Anti-patterns can diminish the value of the Daily Scrum and lead to communication breakdowns, unidentified impediments, and a lack of focus on the Sprint Goal.
